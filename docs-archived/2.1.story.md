# Story 2.1: Implement microphone permission request flow with user-friendly UI

## Status: Completed

## Story

- ✅ **Development Workflow**: Ruby server with automated build process via `./dev.sh`

**Key Technical Achievements to Build Upon:**
- WASM processing pipeline established and performance-validated
- TestFramework class architecture provides testing foundation for permission flows
- Cross-browser compatibility matrix established (can extend for getUserMedia testing)
- Professional UI patterns and error handling established in test suite

### Technical Guidance from Architecture Documents

**Web Audio API Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Dependencies]
- **getUserMedia API**: Required browser feature for microphone access
- **Web Audio API**: AudioContext initialization after permission grant
- **AudioWorklet Integration**: Connect to existing processor from Story 1.2
- **Cross-browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility required

**Frontend UI Patterns**: [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#UI Component Pattern]
- **Component-like Functions**: Use updateStatus(), updateMetric() patterns established
- **State Management**: Centralized state in main controller class
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery patterns
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality with layered enhancements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**File Locations**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Web Frontend]
- **Main Controller**: `web/app.js` - application state management and permission flow
- **HTML Structure**: `web/index.html` - add permission request UI components
- **Styling**: `web/style.css` - child-friendly permission interface styling
- **AudioWorklet**: `web/audio-worklet.js` - integrate microphone stream with existing processor

**Performance Constraints**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Constraints]
- **Audio Latency**: <50ms total (already achieved in EP-001: 0.08ms processing)
- **Buffer Size**: 1024-2048 samples for web stability
- **Processing Budget**: <70% of AudioWorklet quantum
- **Memory Management**: Minimal allocations, cleanup on permission denial

**Browser Compatibility**: [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Browser Support Matrix]
- **Target Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Feature Detection**: Extend existing checks for getUserMedia support
- **Polyfills**: Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- **Error Handling**: Browser-specific getUserMedia error handling

### Development Infrastructure

**Current Setup** (Build upon existing):
- **Development Server**: Ruby server at http://localhost:8080 via `./dev.sh`
- **Test Suite Location**: `web/index.html` with TestFramework class
- **WASM Build Process**: `wasm-pack build --target web` automated in dev script
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Framework established, extend for permission testing

**New Components to Add**:
- Permission request modal in existing HTML structure
- getUserMedia integration in `app.js` controller
- Permission state management in TestFramework
- Child-friendly UI styling in CSS

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] **Unit Tests**: Jest tests for permission request logic (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Browser-based getUserMedia testing with mock implementations, location: `tests/browser-automation/permission-flow.spec.js`
- [x] **E2E Tests**: Cross-browser permission flow validation, location: `tests/browser-automation/cross-browser-permissions.spec.js`

**Manual Test Steps**: 
- Start development server with `./dev.sh`
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/web/ in target browsers
- Test permission request flow: grant, deny, and re-enable scenarios
- Validate child-friendly messaging and visual feedback
- Confirm audio input connection to existing WASM processing pipeline
- Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

| Task 3 | web/app.js | Added real-time pitch display with musical note conversion and live processing metrics | No |

### Completion Notes List

**Task 1 Completed**: Child-friendly permission modal implemented with engaging animations, clear messaging, and comprehensive error handling for all permission denial scenarios.

**Task 2 Completed**: Full getUserMedia API integration with optimal audio constraints for pitch detection, cross-browser compatibility checks, and browser-specific error guidance.

**Task 3 Completed**: Web Audio API context initialization with AudioWorklet integration connecting live microphone input to existing WASM processing pipeline from Story 1.2.

**Task 4 Completed**: Comprehensive testing suite including Jest unit tests, Playwright cross-browser tests, and automated permission flow validation covering all acceptance criteria.

**Integration Achievement**: Successfully established connection between real-time microphone input and the WASM audio processing pipeline from EP-001, confirming the audio pipeline is ready for future processing stories.
