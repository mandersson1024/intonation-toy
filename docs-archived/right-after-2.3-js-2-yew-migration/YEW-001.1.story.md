# Story YEW-001.1: Yew Project Setup

## Status: Completed ✅

## Story

- As a developer
- I want a properly configured Yew development environment
- So that I can begin migrating JavaScript components to Rust with a complete build pipeline, hot reload, and browser compatibility testing

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Trunk build system is configured with optimization flags for both development and production builds
2. Yew dependencies are added to Cargo.toml with correct versions (Yew 0.21, web-sys 0.3, wasm-bindgen 0.2)
3. Basic Yew app renders "Hello World" in browser at http://localhost:8080
4. Hot reload is working for development with automatic recompilation on file changes
5. WASM build pipeline produces optimized bundles for production deployment
6. Development and production build configurations are properly separated
7. Cross-browser compatibility testing framework is established for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
8. WebAssembly loading includes graceful error handling for unsupported browsers
9. Build process integrates with existing development server infrastructure (serve.rb on port 8080)

  - [x] Set up automated browser testing matrix
  - [x] Document browser support requirements and limitations

- [x] Task 5: Integration with Existing Infrastructure (AC: 9)
  - [x] Ensure Yew build works with existing Ruby development server (serve.rb)
  - [x] Update dev.sh script to include Yew build commands
  - [x] Update stop.sh script to handle Yew dev server cleanup
  - [x] Verify WASM files are served with correct MIME types
  - [x] Test integration with existing project structure in web/ directory

- [x] Task 6: Documentation and Validation (AC: All)
  - [x] Create setup documentation for team onboarding
  - [x] Document development workflow with Yew and Trunk
  - [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common Yew setup issues
  - [x] Validate all acceptance criteria are met
  - [x] Test complete development workflow end-to-end

## Dev Notes

### Technology Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#core-dependencies]
- **Frontend Framework**: Yew 0.21 - Rust-native web framework with component-based architecture
- **WASM Compilation**: trunk (Yew-optimized build system with hot reload) + wasm-pack 0.12
- **Browser APIs**: web-sys 0.3 - Rust bindings to browser APIs required for audio processing
- **WASM Runtime**: wasm-bindgen 0.2 - Type-safe Rust/WASM ↔ JavaScript bridge

### Project Structure Integration
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#project-organization]
- Yew source files should be created in `src/` alongside existing Rust audio processing code
- Web output should integrate with existing `web/` directory structure
- Build artifacts go to `pkg/` directory (do not edit manually)
- Development server continues to use port 8080 via serve.rb

### Browser Compatibility Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#browser-compatibility]
**Mandatory Requirements:**
- WebAssembly Support: Required for Yew framework - no JavaScript fallbacks
- Supported: Chrome 69+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+
- Unsupported: Internet Explorer, older browser versions
- Design Decision: No fallbacks provided - users directed to upgrade with clear messaging

### Development Infrastructure Integration
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#development-infrastructure]
- Must integrate with existing Ruby-based server (serve.rb) on port 8080
- Should work with existing automation scripts (dev.sh, stop.sh)
- Build process should support existing WASM output to pkg/ directory
- Hot reload must be functional for efficient development workflow

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:**

- [ ] Unit Tests: Yew component testing (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test: Full Yew app initialization and rendering test (location: `/tests/yew-integration/`)
- [ ] Browser Compatibility E2E: Cross-browser testing for WebAssembly and Yew support (location: `/tests/browser-automation/yew-compatibility.spec.js`)

**Manual Test Steps:**
- Run `trunk serve` and verify Yew app loads at http://localhost:8080
- Test hot reload by modifying Yew component and observing browser updates
- Verify production build creates optimized WASM bundle with `trunk build --release`
- Test browser compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Validate integration with existing development infrastructure (dev.sh, serve.rb)
