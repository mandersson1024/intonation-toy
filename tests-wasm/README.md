# WASM Tests (Future Implementation)

This directory is reserved for WebAssembly-specific tests using `wasm-bindgen-test`.

## When to Implement

Add WASM tests when we have:
- Audio processing modules that need WASM performance validation
- Complex data structures crossing WASM boundaries  
- Module-to-module communication in WASM environment
- Memory management concerns specific to WASM

## What to Test

**WASM-Specific Functionality:**
- ✅ WASM compilation of Rust algorithms
- ✅ Performance of audio processing in WASM vs native
- ✅ Data serialization across WASM boundaries
- ✅ Memory management and buffer handling in WASM
- ✅ Module interactions within WASM environment

**NOT for Browser Integration:**
- ❌ Canvas/WebGPU API testing (use Cypress/Playwright)
- ❌ Web Audio API integration (use E2E tools)
- ❌ DOM manipulation (use component testing tools)
- ❌ User interaction flows (use E2E tools)

## Setup Commands (Future)

```toml
# Add to Cargo.toml [dev-dependencies]
wasm-bindgen-test = "0.3"
```

```bash
# Run WASM tests
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

## Directory Structure (Planned)

```
tests-wasm/
├── unit/
│   ├── audio_algorithms.rs    # Test audio processing in WASM
│   ├── math_utilities.rs      # Test mathematical functions
│   └── data_structures.rs     # Test serialization/boundaries
├── integration/
│   ├── module_communication.rs # Test inter-module data flow
│   └── performance.rs          # Test WASM performance benchmarks
└── README.md                   # This file
```

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (Current):** Native tests only (`cargo test`)
**Phase 2 (Future):** Add WASM tests when we have actual WASM-specific functionality
**Phase 3 (Later):** Add E2E tests for browser integration (Cypress/Playwright)
