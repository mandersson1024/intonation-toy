# Story 1.1: Basic Sprite Rendering

## Metadata
- **Epic**: 1 - Foundation & Development Infrastructure
- **Story Number**: 1.1
- **Status**: Ready for Implementation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.2 (Development Console Component) - Done
- **Estimated Effort**: 12-16 hours

## Story

As a developer,
I want to render sprites with solid colors using the three-d renderer,
so that I can display basic visual elements with GPU acceleration and lay the foundation for the complete graphics pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: Can initialize SpriteRenderer with HTML canvas element using three-d::renderer::Renderer
2. **AC2**: Can render sprites with position, size, rotation, and color properties
3. **AC3**: Achieves 60fps with up to 1000 sprites using three-d optimizations
4. **AC4**: Supports WebGL context creation and management via three-d
5. **AC5**: Integrates with the existing event dispatcher system for graphics events
6. **AC6**: Provides basic depth testing and sorting functionality

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.2 successfully implemented the development console with comprehensive command system, event handling, and build configuration separation. The YAGNI principle was applied effectively with conditional compilation for development features. The modular architecture foundation is solid and ready for graphics integration.

Key insights from previous stories:
- Event-driven architecture is working well with typed events
- Conditional compilation pattern (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`) is established
- Module structure in `/src/modules/` provides good organization
- Build configuration separation (dev.toml/prod.toml) is functional

### Data Models

Based on the sprite-renderer architecture and three-d integration, implement these core data structures:

```rust
// Core sprite representation
pub struct Sprite {
    pub id: SpriteId,
    pub position: Vec2,
    pub size: Vec2, 
    pub rotation: f32,
    pub color: Color,
    pub depth: f32,
    pub visible: bool,
}

// Sprite renderer using three-d
pub struct SpriteRenderer {
    renderer: three_d::renderer::Renderer,
    camera: three_d::renderer::Camera2D,
    render_target: three_d::renderer::RenderTarget,
    quad_geometry: three_d::renderer::Geometry,
    color_material: three_d::renderer::ColorMaterial,
}

// Graphics events for event dispatcher integration
pub enum GraphicsEvent {
    RenderComplete,
    FrameRendered { frame_time: f32 },
    SpriteRendered { sprite_id: SpriteId },
    RendererError { error: String },
}
```

### API Specifications

The SpriteRenderer must integrate with three-d's renderer module for WebGL abstraction:

```rust
impl SpriteRenderer {
    pub fn new(canvas: &web_sys::HtmlCanvasElement) -> Result<Self, RendererError>;
    pub fn render(&mut self, sprites: &[Sprite]) -> Result<(), RendererError>;
    pub fn clear(&mut self) -> Result<(), RendererError>;
    pub fn resize(&mut self, width: u32, height: u32) -> Result<(), RendererError>;
    pub fn set_camera(&mut self, camera: Camera2D);
    
    // Event system integration
    pub fn set_event_dispatcher(&mut self, dispatcher: GraphicsEventDispatcher);
}
```

Performance requirements:
- 60fps rendering with 1000 sprites
- WebGL context creation via three-d
- GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline
- Efficient memory management with pre-allocated buffers

## Project Structure Notes

The graphics module integrates seamlessly with the existing modular architecture established in Stories 1.1 and 1.2. The three-d renderer provides a high-level abstraction over WebGL, eliminating the need for direct WebGL programming while maintaining performance and browser compatibility.

The event-driven architecture established in previous stories provides an excellent foundation for graphics event integration, allowing the renderer to communicate with other modules through typed events.

## Deviation Analysis

No significant deviations from epic requirements identified. The story aligns well with the three-d renderer architecture and follows the established patterns from previous stories. The sprite renderer implementation leverages three-d's proven WebGL abstraction while maintaining the modular, event-driven architecture.
