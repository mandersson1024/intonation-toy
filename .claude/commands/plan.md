description: Create an implementation plan with TODO list saved as a file
---

Create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

This command will:
- Research the current codebase to understand existing patterns
- Analyze the requirements and constraints
- Create a step-by-step implementation plan
- Save the plan as a TODO list file in the project

Please create an implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Research the codebase first, then create a detailed plan with:
1. Current state analysis
2. Implementation steps broken down into specific tasks
3. Dependencies and order of operations
4. Testing considerations
5. Potential challenges and solutions

Save the plan as a markdown file with a TODO checklist format.
