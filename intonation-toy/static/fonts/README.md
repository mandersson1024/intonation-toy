# Font Directory

Place the Roboto-Regular.ttf font file in this directory. The font should be a standard TrueType font file (approximately 100-200KB) that will be embedded in the Rust code using the `include_bytes!` macro.

The font file is expected to be named exactly `Roboto-Regular.ttf` and will be used for rendering note labels in the application.
