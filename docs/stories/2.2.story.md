# Story 2.2: Set up Web Audio API context and microphone input processing

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a **music educator or student**
- I want **the Web Audio API to initialize properly and process microphone input in real-time**
- so that **I can receive live audio data for pitch detection and analysis**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: Web Audio API AudioContext initializes properly after microphone permission is granted
2. **AC2**: Microphone input stream connects to AudioContext with appropriate audio constraints
3. **AC3**: AudioWorklet processes live microphone input with stable audio flow
4. **AC4**: Audio processing pipeline maintains consistent sample rate and buffer size across browsers
5. **AC5**: Real-time audio data flows from microphone through WASM processing pipeline established in EP-001
6. **AC6**: Audio latency remains within acceptable bounds (<50ms total) for real-time user experience

### Technical Guidance from Architecture Documents

**Web Audio API Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Dependencies]
- **AudioContext Configuration**: Optimal settings for pitch detection workloads
- **Sample Rate Management**: Consistent 44.1kHz or 48kHz across processing chain
- **Buffer Size Optimization**: Balance between latency and processing stability
- **AudioWorklet Integration**: Connect live input to existing worklet processor

**Performance Constraints**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Constraints]
- **Total Audio Latency**: <50ms end-to-end (microphone to processing)
- **Processing Budget**: Maintain EP-001 performance (0.08-0.09ms WASM processing)
- **Buffer Management**: Optimize for real-time without audio dropouts
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal allocations in audio processing thread

**Browser Compatibility**: [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Browser Support Matrix]
- **AudioContext Support**: Chrome 66+, Firefox 60+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+
- **AudioWorklet Support**: All target browsers validated in EP-001
- **getUserMedia Integration**: Build upon Story 2.1 implementation
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation for unsupported configurations

### File Locations and Integration Points

**Primary Files**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Web Frontend]
- **Main Controller**: `web/app.js` - extend PitchVisualizerApp class
- **AudioWorklet**: `web/audio-worklet.js` - enhance for live audio processing
- **HTML Structure**: `web/index.html` - add audio processing status indicators
- **WASM Integration**: Use existing `pkg/` WASM modules from EP-001

**Integration with Existing Components:**
- **Story 2.1**: Build upon permission flow and initial WASM connection
- **EP-001**: Utilize established pitch detection algorithms and performance benchmarks
- **Test Framework**: Extend existing testing infrastructure for live audio validation

### Development Infrastructure

**Current Setup** (Build upon existing):
- **Development Server**: Ruby server at http://localhost:8080 via `./dev.sh`
- **WASM Build Process**: Automated in dev script, EP-001 foundation ready
- **Test Suite Location**: `web/index.html` with established TestFramework
- **Performance Monitoring**: Extend existing metrics for live audio processing

**New Components to Add**:
- AudioContext initialization and management in `app.js`
- Live audio stream processing in AudioWorklet
- Real-time performance monitoring and latency measurement
- Audio processing status indicators in UI

### Testing Strategy

**Required Test Coverage**:
- **Unit Tests**: AudioContext initialization, stream connection, error handling
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end audio flow from microphone to WASM processing
- **Performance Tests**: Latency measurement, buffer underrun detection, stability validation
- **Cross-browser Tests**: AudioContext behavior across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

**Manual Testing Procedures**:
- Real microphone input validation across different devices
- Audio quality assessment with various input sources
- Latency measurement with external audio analysis tools
- User experience validation with actual audio input scenarios

### Success Metrics

**Technical Benchmarks**:
- **Audio Latency**: <50ms total (microphone input to WASM processing output)
- **Processing Stability**: No audio dropouts during continuous operation
- **Sample Rate Consistency**: Stable sample rate across entire audio chain
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Consistent behavior across all target browsers

**Integration Validation**:
