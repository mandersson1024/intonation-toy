## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.1 successfully implemented the core audio infrastructure with:
- AudioContext initialization and management
- Microphone manager with getUserMedia integration
- AudioWorklet processor for real-time audio processing
- Stream management with reconnection logic
- Console commands for audio system control

The audio module structure is established at `/src/modules/audio/` with proper module exports and integration with the console system. The AudioWorklet processor is ready for buffer integration with fixed 128-sample processing chunks.

### Technical Requirements

#### Buffer Architecture
Audio buffer system must support:
- **Circular Buffers**: Efficient streaming with minimal memory allocation
- **Hard-Coded Sizes**: 1024 samples (production), 256-2048 samples (development) as compile-time constants, all multiples of 128-sample input chunks
- **Sequential Analysis**: Non-overlapping buffer analysis for simplified processing
- **Memory Pools**: Pre-allocated buffers for zero-allocation processing
- **Overflow Protection**: Graceful handling of buffer overflow conditions

#### Performance Constraints
- **Memory Limit**: ≤50MB GPU memory for all buffer allocation
- **Processing Latency**: ≤30ms (production), ≤50ms (development)
- **Zero-Allocation**: Steady-state processing without memory allocation
- **Real-Time**: No blocking operations during audio processing

#### Data Structures Required
Based on PRD and architecture requirements:
- `CircularBuffer<T>`: Ring buffer for streaming audio data
- `BufferConstants`: Hard-coded buffer size constants for compile-time configuration
- `BufferAnalyzer`: Sequential buffer analysis without overlap
- `BufferPool`: Pre-allocated buffer management
- `BufferMetrics`: Performance monitoring and debugging

#### AudioWorklet Integration
Buffer system must integrate with existing AudioWorklet processor:
- **Real-Time Filling**: Buffers filled from AudioWorklet 128-sample chunks
- **Buffer Size Alignment**: All buffer sizes must be multiples of 128 samples for efficient chunk processing
- **Thread Safety**: Safe access from audio processing thread
- **Synchronization**: Proper coordination between audio and main threads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from buffer-related errors

### File Locations

Based on established modular architecture:
- **Main buffer module**: `/src/modules/audio/buffer.rs` - Core buffer implementations
- **Buffer pools**: `/src/modules/audio/buffer_pool.rs` - Memory pool management
- **Buffer analyzer**: `/src/modules/audio/buffer_analyzer.rs` - Sequential analysis
- **AudioWorklet integration**: Update `/src/modules/audio/worklet.rs` - Buffer integration
- **Console commands**: Update `/src/modules/console/command_registry.rs` - Add buffer commands
- **Module exports**: Update `/src/modules/audio/mod.rs` - Export buffer components

### Browser API Integration

#### Web Audio API Requirements
- **AudioWorklet**: Real-time buffer filling from 128-sample chunks
- **SharedArrayBuffer**: For efficient buffer sharing (where available)
- **Performance API**: For timing measurements and latency monitoring

#### Memory Management
- **WebAssembly Linear Memory**: Efficient memory layout for audio buffers
- **Arc<RefCell<>>**: Safe shared access to buffer state
- **Memory Profiling**: Runtime memory usage monitoring

### Testing Requirements

Following the established phased testing strategy:
- **Phase 1 (Native Tests)**: Buffer data structures, circular buffer operations, memory management
- **Phase 2 (WASM Tests)**: AudioWorklet integration, Web Audio API buffer handling
- **Phase 3 (E2E Tests)**: Real-time audio processing with buffer management

### Console Command Integration

Buffer console commands to add to existing DevCommand system:
- `buffer-status` - Show current buffer configuration and usage
- `buffer-metrics` - Display buffer performance metrics
- `buffer-reset` - Reset buffer state and clear data
- `buffer-debug` - Enable/disable buffer debugging output

### Error Handling Strategy

Buffer-specific error handling:
- **Buffer Overflow**: Graceful handling with oldest data eviction
- **Memory Allocation**: Fallback to smaller buffer sizes
- **Thread Synchronization**: Recovery from concurrent access errors
- **Performance Degradation**: Adaptive buffer sizing based on performance

### Mathematical Windowing Functions

Windowing functions for spectral analysis:
- **Hamming Window**: Default windowing for general-purpose analysis
- **Blackman Window**: Higher frequency resolution for pitch detection
- **Hann Window**: Reduced spectral leakage for clean signals
- **Compile-Time Selection**: Windowing function selection at compile time

### Memory Usage Monitoring

Buffer memory tracking:
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Current memory usage reporting
- **Peak Usage**: Maximum memory usage tracking
- **Allocation Patterns**: Memory allocation pattern analysis
- **Leak Detection**: Buffer memory leak detection and reporting

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Cargo Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] WASM Integration Tests: (Test Location): location: `/tests/wasm.rs` (Phase 2 - WASM-specific functionality)
- [ ] E2E Tests: location: `/e2e/audio-processing/buffer-management.test.ts` (Phase 3 - browser integration)

Manual Test Steps:
- Run development build with `trunk serve`
- Test buffer console commands: `buffer-status`, `buffer-metrics`
- Monitor memory usage during extended audio processing
- Verify buffer overflow protection with extreme input scenarios
- Test sequential buffer analysis without overlap
- Validate zero-allocation processing during steady-state operation
