### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#presentation-layer]

**Theme System Architecture Requirements:**
- **Performance**: Theme switching in <100ms without visual artifacts
- **Graphics Compatibility**: Full integration with wgpu rendering pipeline
- **Developer Experience**: Rich configuration API for shaders and animations
- **User Experience**: Zero configuration complexity for end users
- **Build Integration**: Themes compiled into application, no runtime loading

**Theme Definition Pattern:**
```rust
pub struct ThemeDefinition {
    pub name: &'static str,
    pub display_name: &'static str,
    pub description: &'static str,
    
    // Visual Configuration
    pub color_palette: ColorPalette,
    pub material_properties: MaterialProperties,
    pub lighting_config: LightingRig,
    
    // Rendering Configuration  
    pub shader_variants: ShaderSet,
    pub particle_systems: ParticleConfig,
    pub animation_timings: AnimationConfig,
    pub post_effects: EffectChain,
}

// Compile-time theme registry
const AVAILABLE_THEMES: &[ThemeDefinition] = &[
    PLAYFUL_THEME,     // Vibrant, dynamic visualization
    SCIENTIFIC_THEME,  // Analytical, precise visualization
];

pub trait ThemeManager: Send + Sync {
    fn get_available_themes(&self) -> Vec<ThemeMetadata>;
    fn get_current_theme(&self) -> &ThemeDefinition;  
    fn set_theme(&mut self, choice: UserThemeChoice) -> Result<(), ThemeError>;
    fn get_theme_preview(&self, choice: UserThemeChoice) -> ThemePreview;
}
```

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#graphics-technology]

**wgpu Theme Integration:**
- **Shader Pipeline**: Theme-specific shader variants with hot-swapping capability
- **Resource Management**: Per-theme texture and uniform buffer management
- **Performance**: Efficient theme switching without pipeline stalls
- **Compatibility**: WebGL backend support for all theme features

**Theme Asset Organization:**
```
src/themes/
├── mod.rs                    # Theme registry and manager
├── definitions/              # Individual theme definitions
│   ├── playful.rs           # Vibrant, dynamic theme
│   └── scientific.rs        # Analytical, precise theme
├── shaders/                  # Per-theme shader variants
│   ├── playful/             # Playful theme shaders
│   └── scientific/          # Scientific theme shaders
├── animations/               # Animation configuration per theme
├── materials/                # Material property definitions per theme
└── presets/                  # Preset configurations per theme
```

### Graphics Foundations Integration
[Source: docs/stories/5.28.story.md - Graphics Foundations Module Complete]

**Graphics Integration Requirements:**
- Integration with completed Graphics Foundations wgpu context
- Theme-aware rendering pipeline management
- Graphics capability-based theme feature selection
- Performance-optimized theme resource loading

**Integration Pattern:**
```rust
impl ThemeManager {
    pub fn initialize_with_graphics(
        &mut self, 
        graphics: &GraphicsFoundationsModule
    ) -> Result<(), ThemeError> {
        // Validate theme compatibility with graphics capabilities
        let capabilities = graphics.get_graphics_capabilities();
        self.validate_theme_compatibility(&capabilities)?;
        
        // Initialize theme-specific rendering resources
        self.setup_theme_rendering_context(graphics)?;
        
        // Load initial theme based on user preference or default
        self.load_initial_theme()?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Conditional Compilation Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#conditional-compilation]

**Debug Overlay Style Isolation:**
- Debug overlay styling must remain completely independent of theme system
- Use hardcoded, simple functional styling for debug components
- Conditional compilation ensures debug styling excluded from production
- Debug overlay readability maintained across all theme changes

**Debug Style Pattern:**
```rust
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
pub struct DebugOverlayStyle {
    pub background: &'static str,     // "rgba(0,0,0,0.8)"
    pub text_color: &'static str,     // "#ffffff"
    pub border_color: &'static str,   // "#666666"
    // No theming complexity - just functional readability
}

#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
impl DebugOverlayStyle {
    pub const fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            background: "rgba(0,0,0,0.8)",
            text_color: "#ffffff",
            border_color: "#666666",
        }
    }
}
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

**Theme System Performance Standards:**
- **Theme Switching**: <100ms for complete theme transition
- **Asset Loading**: Theme resources preloaded for instant switching
- **Memory Management**: Efficient theme resource allocation and cleanup
- **Rendering Performance**: Zero performance degradation during theme operations

### User Experience Design
[Source: Epic 005 - Story 029 Requirements]

**User Theme Selection Interface:**
- Simple, intuitive theme selection with clear visual previews
- Instant feedback during theme switching
- Theme persistence across browser sessions
- Minimal cognitive load - users choose personality, not technical details

**Theme Personalities:**
- **Playful Theme**: Vibrant colors, dynamic animations, engaging particle effects
- **Scientific Theme**: Clean lines, precise visualizations, analytical aesthetics

## Testing

Unit Tests: `#[cfg(test)]` modules next to implementation, coverage requirement: 90%

Integration Tests: `src/modules/presentation_layer/theme_integration_tests.rs`

Performance Tests: Validate theme switching <100ms requirement

Graphics Integration Tests: Verify wgpu pipeline compatibility with all themes

Manual Test Steps:

1. Verify theme selection UI displays both themes with clear previews
2. Test theme switching completes in <100ms without visual artifacts
3. Confirm theme persistence works across browser sessions
4. Validate Graphics Foundations integration maintains rendering performance
5. Test theme shader pipeline hot-swapping functionality
6. Verify debug overlay styling remains independent of theme changes
7. Confirm production builds exclude debug styling completely
8. Test theme fallback system with limited graphics capabilities
