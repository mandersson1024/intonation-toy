# Story YEW-001.2: Browser Compatibility Infrastructure

## Status: Complete ✅

## Story

- As a user
- I want the Yew application to work across all supported browsers
- So that I can access the pitch training tool regardless of browser choice with reliable WebAssembly loading and graceful error handling

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility is verified with automated testing
2. WebAssembly loading includes graceful fallback messaging for unsupported browsers
3. Browser feature detection is working for WebAssembly, Web Audio API, and MediaDevices
4. Error handling displays user-friendly messages for unsupported browsers
5. Automated browser testing matrix is set up for cross-browser validation
6. Browser compatibility detection integrates with existing error management system
7. Performance baseline is established across all supported browser versions

  - [x] Set up alerts for performance regression by browser

- [x] Task 5: Integration and Documentation (AC: All)
  - [x] Integrate browser detection with main application flow
  - [x] Update browser support documentation
  - [x] Create troubleshooting guide for browser-specific issues
  - [x] Validate all acceptance criteria across browser matrix
  - [x] Test complete user journey in each supported browser

## Dev Notes

### Browser Support Matrix
[Source: yew-migration-product-plan.md#browser-compatibility]
**Supported Browsers:**
- **Chrome**: 69+ (WebAssembly 1.0, Web Audio API)
- **Firefox**: 76+ (WebAssembly 1.0, Web Audio API)
- **Safari**: 14.1+ (WebAssembly 1.0, Web Audio API, MediaDevices)
- **Edge**: 79+ (Chromium-based, full WebAssembly support)

**Unsupported:** Internet Explorer, older browser versions

### Technical Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#browser-apis]
**Required Browser APIs:**
- WebAssembly 1.0 support (mandatory for Yew)
- Web Audio API (for real-time audio processing)
- MediaDevices API (for microphone access)
- AudioWorklet (for low-latency audio processing)

### Integration Points
[Source: YEW-001.1.story.md#browser-compatibility]
- Must work with browser detection from YEW-001.1
- Should integrate with existing error management system
- Performance monitoring should feed into overall application metrics

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Required Tests:**
- [ ] Unit Tests: Browser capability detection functions (coverage: 90%)
- [ ] Integration Tests: Cross-browser WebAssembly loading scenarios
- [ ] E2E Tests: Complete user flow in each supported browser (location: `/tests/browser-automation/`)
- [ ] Performance Tests: Browser-specific latency and loading time benchmarks

**Manual Test Steps:**
- Test application loading in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Verify error messages display correctly in unsupported browsers
- Validate audio permission flows work across all browsers
- Test WebAssembly loading performance in each browser
- Confirm graceful degradation messaging appears appropriately
