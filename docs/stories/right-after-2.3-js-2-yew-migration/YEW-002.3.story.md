- pitch_detection 0.4 for real-time pitch analysis algorithms

### Existing Audio Engine Analysis
[Source: src/audio/engine.rs]
**Current Implementation Features to Migrate:**
- AudioEngine struct with comprehensive audio processing pipeline
- Real-time audio processing with performance monitoring
- Pitch detection integration with configurable algorithms
- Performance metrics tracking and latency optimization
- Buffer optimization and memory management patterns
- WASM interface methods for JavaScript integration

**Required Yew Integration Pattern:**
```rust
#[derive(Properties, PartialEq)]
pub struct AudioEngineProps {
    pub media_stream: Option<MediaStream>,
    pub on_audio_data: Callback<AudioData>,
    pub on_performance_update: Callback<PerformanceMetrics>,
    #[prop_or(10.0)]
    pub target_latency_ms: f32,
}

#[function_component(AudioEngineComponent)]
pub fn audio_engine_component(props: &AudioEngineProps) -> Html {
    // Yew component wrapper for AudioEngine service
}
```

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#rust-wasm-core]
**Required File Structure:**
- `src/services/audio_engine.rs` - Migrated AudioEngine service for Yew
- `src/components/audio_engine.rs` - Yew component wrapper
- `src/audio/` - Existing audio processing modules (engine.rs to be adapted)
