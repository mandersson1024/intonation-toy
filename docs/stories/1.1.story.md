# Story 1.1: Set up WASM compilation pipeline with wasm-pack and basic audio processing structure

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a **developer**
- I want **a working WASM compilation pipeline using wasm-pack with basic audio processing structure**
- so that **I can build and compile Rust audio processing code to WebAssembly for browser integration**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: WASM compilation pipeline successfully builds Rust code to WebAssembly using wasm-pack
2. **AC2**: Generated WASM module loads and initializes in Chrome, Firefox, Safari browsers
3. **AC3**: Basic audio processing structure is established with proper wasm-bindgen exports
4. **AC4**: Project structure follows defined organization with src/audio/ modules
5. **AC5**: Build process generates working pkg/ directory with WASM bindings

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Initialize Rust project with WASM dependencies (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create Cargo.toml with wasm-pack build configuration
  - [x] Add required dependencies: wasm-bindgen, web-sys, js-sys
  - [x] Add audio processing crate: pitch_detection 0.4
  - [x] Configure [lib] section for cdylib crate type
  
- [x] Task 2: Create basic audio processing structure (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Create src/lib.rs with wasm_bindgen entry point
  - [x] Create src/audio/mod.rs module structure
  - [x] Create src/audio/engine.rs with basic AudioEngine struct
  - [x] Implement basic WASM-exported audio processing function
  
- [x] Task 3: Set up wasm-pack build pipeline (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Configure wasm-pack build for web target
  - [x] Verify pkg/ directory generation with proper bindings
  - [x] Create basic HTML test page to verify WASM loading
  - [x] Test WASM module initialization across target browsers
  
- [x] Task 4: Verify cross-browser compatibility (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Test WASM loading in Chrome (latest)
  - [x] Test WASM loading in Firefox (latest)
  - [x] Test WASM loading in Safari (latest)
  - [x] Document any browser-specific compatibility issues

### Technical Guidance from Architecture Documents

**Project Structure**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Project Organization]
```
src/
├── lib.rs                 # WASM entry point with wasm_bindgen
├── audio/                 # Audio processing (compiled to WASM)
│   ├── mod.rs             # Audio module exports
│   ├── engine.rs          # Core audio engine

└── utils.rs               # WASM utilities and helpers
```

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Dependencies]
- **WASM Compilation**: wasm-pack 0.12 (Rust to WebAssembly toolchain)
- **WASM Runtime**: wasm-bindgen 0.2 (Rust/WASM ↔ JavaScript bridge)
- **Pitch Detection**: pitch_detection 0.4 (Autocorrelation algorithms - Rust compiled to WASM)

**Performance Constraints**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Constraints]
- **Audio Latency**: <50ms total (web audio constraints)
- **Buffer Size**: 1024-2048 samples (larger buffers for web stability)
- **Processing Budget**: <70% of AudioWorklet quantum for processing
- **Memory**: Minimal allocations, leverage WASM memory efficiency

**Browser Compatibility**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Browser Compatibility]
- Target browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Required browser features: Web Audio API, WebAssembly support, Canvas API

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Cargo Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80% [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]
- [x] Jest Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/tests/wasm-integration/build.spec.js` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration Tests]
- [x] Manual Browser Testing: Cross-browser WASM loading verification [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Manual Testing Requirements]

**Enhanced Testing Infrastructure Delivered** (Beyond Original Scope):
- [x] **Professional Browser Test Suite**: http://localhost:8080/web/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Interactive Browser Test Suite]
- [x] **TestFramework Class Architecture**: Centralized test management with performance measurement
- [x] **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: μs-level precision timing with quality thresholds
- [x] **Automated Test Suite**: One-click comprehensive testing with progress tracking
- [x] **Stress Testing**: 1000+ iteration performance validation
- [x] **Development Server Infrastructure**: Ruby-based server with auto-cleanup and WASM support

**Performance Benchmarks Established**:
- **Excellent**: < 100μs per buffer processing
- **Good**: < 500μs per buffer processing  
- **Needs Optimization**: > 500μs per buffer processing

Manual Test Steps (Enhanced):
- Run `./dev.sh` for automated build + serve (always port 8080)
- Access professional test suite at http://localhost:8080/web/
- Execute comprehensive test suite with performance monitoring
- Validate across Chrome, Firefox, Safari with real-time metrics
- Stress test with 1000+ iterations for reliability validation
