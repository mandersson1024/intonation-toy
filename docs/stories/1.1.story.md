## Story
As a developer,
I want a properly configured Rust/WebAssembly project with Yew framework,
so that I can begin building the pitch detection application with hot reload and debugging capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: Cargo.toml configured with Yew 0.21, web-sys, pitch-detection, and rustfft dependencies
2. **AC2**: Trunk configuration files created for development and production builds
3. **AC3**: Basic Yew application renders and serves at localhost:8080
4. **AC4**: Hot reload functionality works correctly during development
5. **AC5**: Build system produces optimized WebAssembly for production
6. **AC6**: Project structure follows modular architecture as specified

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous story insights are available.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this initial setup story. Future stories will implement audio processing data structures including:
- `PitchEvent` struct for pitch detection results
- `VolumeEvent` struct for volume level data
- `SpectrumEvent` struct for FFT analysis data
[Source: docs/tech-spec.md#detailed-module-specifications]

### API Specifications
No external API specifications required for this story. Future stories will implement:
- Web Audio API integration for microphone input
- AudioWorklet setup for low-latency audio processing
[Source: docs/tech-spec.md#microphone-audio-input-module]

### Component Specifications
For this initial story, the basic Yew application should include:
- Main `App` component as entry point
- Basic HTML structure for the pitch detection interface
- Placeholder divs for future audio visualization components
[Source: docs/tech-spec.md#system-architecture]

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure, maintain the following organization:
- **Source code**: `/src/lib.rs` (main entry point)
- **Modules**: `/src/modules/` (for future modular components)
- **Build configs**: `/build-configs/dev.toml` and `/build-configs/release.toml`
- **Dependencies**: Update existing `/Cargo.toml`
- **HTML entry**: Update existing `/index.html`
[Source: existing project structure and docs/tech-spec.md#implementation-phases]

### Testing Requirements
Initial testing setup should include:
- Basic Cargo test configuration
- Unit test structure for future audio processing modules
- Integration test framework preparation
[Source: docs/tech-spec.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- **WebAssembly Compatibility**: Ensure all dependencies support WASM compilation
- **Bundle Size**: Target ≤500KB compressed for production builds
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 66+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz standard audio processing
- **Build System**: Use Trunk for WASM bundling with hot reload
[Source: docs/tech-spec.md#performance-requirements and #browser-compatibility]

### Dependencies Requirements
Based on technical specification, configure these core dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies]
yew = { version = "0.21", features = ["csr"] }
web-sys = "0.3"
pitch-detection = "0.3"
rustfft = "6.0"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```
[Source: docs/tech-spec.md#core-dependencies]

### Build Configuration Requirements
Development build should include:
- Debug symbols and source maps
- Hot reload capability
- Verbose logging
- Multiple buffer sizes for testing (128-2048 samples)
- Development console availability

Production build should include:
- Maximum optimization (level 3)
- No debug symbols
- Minimal bundle size
- Single optimized buffer size (1024 samples)
- Development console disabled
[Source: docs/tech-spec.md#build-configurations]

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Update Project Configuration (AC: 1, 6)
- [x] Update `Cargo.toml` package name from "hello-yew" to "pitch-toy"
- [x] Add required dependencies: web-sys, pitch-detection, rustfft with correct versions
- [x] Configure crate-type as ["cdylib"] for WebAssembly output
- [x] Update project description and repository URL
- [x] Verify WASM compatibility of all dependencies

### Task 2: Create Trunk Build Configurations (AC: 2, 5)
- [ ] Create `build-configs/dev.toml` with development settings
  - Enable debug symbols and source maps
  - Configure hot reload settings
  - Set development-specific optimization levels
- [ ] Create `build-configs/release.toml` with production settings
  - Enable maximum optimization (level 3)
  - Disable debug symbols
  - Configure bundle size optimization
- [ ] Test both build configurations produce valid WebAssembly

### Task 3: Implement Basic Yew Application Structure (AC: 3, 6)
- [ ] Update `src/lib.rs` with proper pitch-toy application structure
- [ ] Create placeholder components for future audio processing modules
- [ ] Implement basic HTML structure for pitch detection interface
- [ ] Add CSS classes for future theme management integration
- [ ] Ensure modular architecture alignment with `/src/modules/` structure

### Task 4: Setup Development Server and Hot Reload (AC: 4)
- [ ] Configure Trunk to serve at localhost:8080
- [ ] Verify hot reload functionality with code changes
- [ ] Test CSS hot reload capability
- [ ] Ensure development server stability during rapid changes

### Task 5: Verify Production Build System (AC: 5)

- [ ] Add placeholder module files for future implementation:
  - `audio/audio_processor.rs`
  - `debug/dev_console.rs`
  - `events/event_dispatcher.rs`
  - `graphics/graphics_renderer.rs`
  - `presentation/presentation_layer.rs`
  - `themes/theme_manager.rs`
- [ ] Update `src/lib.rs` to reference module structure

- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Test complete development setup on clean environment

## Project Structure Notes
The current project structure aligns well with the planned modular architecture. The existing `/src/modules/` directory provides a good foundation for the future implementation of core modules as specified in the technical specification.

## Deviation Analysis
No significant deviations between epic requirements and architecture constraints identified. The story aligns well with the foundational phase requirements outlined in the technical specification.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Trunk development server runs successfully at localhost:8080 with hot reload
- [ ] Production build creates optimized WebAssembly bundle under size limits
- [ ] Basic Yew application renders correctly in all supported browsers
- [ ] Project structure supports future modular development
