**Key Context from Previous Stories:**
- Epic 003 completed comprehensive Audio Foundations module with device management
- Device manager provides audio capability detection that needs integration
- Event system from Epic 001 provides TypedEventBus for platform events
- Application Core from Epic 002 provides module registry and configuration system

### Source Tree Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#platform-abstraction-layer]

**Platform Module Location**: `src/modules/platform_abstraction/`
**Key Files for Implementation:**
- Main module: `platform_abstraction_module.rs`
- Browser compatibility: `browser_compat.rs`
- Device capabilities: `device_capabilities.rs`
- WebAssembly bridge: `wasm_bridge.rs`
- Optimization engine: `optimization_engine.rs`
- Migration source: `src/legacy/active/services/browser_compat.rs`

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#platform-abstraction]

**Platform Technology Stack:**
- **Browser Detection**: Enhanced user agent parsing with feature detection
- **WebAssembly Integration**: Optimized WASM-JS boundary utilities
- **Device Capabilities**: Hardware acceleration and performance profiling
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Chrome 69+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+

### Migration Strategy Context
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#migration-approach]

**Migration Requirements:**
- **Preserve Functionality**: 100% preservation of existing browser compatibility
- **Performance Requirements**: Platform detection <5ms, cached thereafter
- **Memory Constraints**: <2MB additional memory overhead for platform abstractions
- **Integration Points**: Audio Foundations, Application Core, Event Bus

**Migration Pattern:**
```rust
// Platform Abstraction Module Architecture:
pub struct PlatformAbstractionModule {
    browser_compat: Arc<BrowserCompatibility>,
    device_capabilities: Arc<DeviceCapabilityDetector>,
    wasm_bridge: Arc<WasmBridge>,
    optimization_engine: Arc<PlatformOptimizationEngine>,
    event_bus: Arc<TypedEventBus>,
}

impl Module for PlatformAbstractionModule {
    fn initialize(&mut self) -> Result<(), ModuleError> {
        // Detect browser and capabilities
        let browser_info = self.browser_compat.detect_browser()?;
        let capabilities = self.device_capabilities.detect_all()?;
        
        // Apply platform optimizations
        self.optimization_engine.apply_optimizations(&browser_info, &capabilities)?;
        
        // Publish platform ready event
        self.publish_platform_ready_event(browser_info, capabilities);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 001, 002, 003 Implementation Context]

**Event Bus Integration:**
- **Event Priorities**: Critical (<1ms), High (<5ms), Normal (<100ms), Low (best effort)
- **Platform Events**: Browser detection, capability changes, optimization updates
- **Error Events**: Platform failures with recovery suggestions

**Application Core Integration:**
- **Module Registration**: Register with Module Registry for lifecycle management
- **Configuration**: Integrate with Configuration Coordinator for platform settings
- **Dependency Injection**: Use DI container for component management

**Audio Foundations Integration:**
- **Device Manager**: Coordinate with existing audio device capability detection
- **Performance Monitor**: Integrate platform metrics with audio performance monitoring
- **Optimization**: Platform optimizations should enhance audio processing performance

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#performance-requirements]

**Platform Detection Performance:**
- Target latency: <5ms for initial platform detection
- Caching: Results cached for subsequent access (<0.1ms)
- Memory usage: <2MB additional overhead for platform abstractions
- Browser optimization: 10-30% performance improvement per browser

**Integration Performance:**
- Event publishing: <1ms for critical platform events
- Device capability detection: <10ms for complete assessment
- Optimization application: <5ms during initialization
- No audio processing regression: Maintain <10ms audio latency

### Testing
