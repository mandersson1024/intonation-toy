## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/4.20.story.md - Platform Abstraction Module Complete]

**Key Context from Story 4.20:**
- Platform Abstraction Module fully implemented with browser detection foundation
- Browser compatibility migration completed from legacy `browser_compat.rs`
- Platform optimization engine structure exists but needs browser-specific profiles
- Event system integration established for platform state changes
- Device capability detection integrated with Audio Foundations

### Source Tree Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#platform-abstraction-layer]

**Enhancement Target Files:**
- Main optimization engine: `src/modules/platform_abstraction/optimization_engine.rs`
- Browser compatibility: `src/modules/platform_abstraction/browser_compat.rs`
- Platform module: `src/modules/platform_abstraction/platform_abstraction_module.rs`
- Module exports: `src/modules/platform_abstraction/mod.rs`

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#performance-requirements]

**Browser Support Requirements:**
- **Chrome 69+**: WebAssembly SIMD support, AudioWorklet optimization
- **Firefox 76+**: WebAssembly threading, enhanced audio processing
- **Safari 14.1+**: WebAssembly streaming compilation, Audio API compatibility
- **Edge 79+**: Chromium-based optimizations, shared memory support

**Performance Targets:**
- **Optimization Impact**: 10-30% performance improvement per browser
- **Detection Accuracy**: 99%+ browser identification accuracy
- **Monitoring Overhead**: <1ms for real-time performance monitoring
- **Fallback Response**: <100ms to activate graceful degradation

### Technical Implementation Guidelines
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

**Browser Optimization Architecture:**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct OptimizationProfile {
    pub webassembly_optimizations: WasmOptimizations,
    pub audio_optimizations: AudioOptimizations,
    pub memory_optimizations: MemoryOptimizations,
    pub threading_optimizations: ThreadingOptimizations,
}

pub struct WasmOptimizations {
    pub enable_simd: bool,
    pub enable_threading: bool,
    pub streaming_compilation: bool,
    pub bulk_memory_operations: bool,
    pub reference_types: bool,
}

pub struct AudioOptimizations {
    pub preferred_buffer_size: u32,
    pub enable_audio_worklet: bool,
    pub enable_shared_array_buffer: bool,
    pub audio_context_options: AudioContextOptions,
    pub latency_hint: AudioContextLatencyCategory,
}
```

**Browser-Specific Optimization Requirements:**
- **Chrome**: Enable SIMD, 1024 buffer size, shared array buffers
- **Firefox**: Threading optimizations, 2048 buffer size, standard audio worklet
- **Safari**: Streaming compilation disabled, 2048 buffer size, compatibility mode
- **Edge**: Chromium optimizations, shared memory, 1024 buffer size

### Event Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 001 Event Bus Implementation]

**Optimization Events to Publish:**
- **OptimizationProfileApplied**: When browser-specific optimizations are activated
- **PerformanceThresholdBreached**: When performance monitoring detects issues
- **GracefulDegradationActivated**: When fallback mechanisms are triggered
- **BrowserUpgradeRecommended**: When user guidance suggests browser updates

**Event Priority Classifications:**
- **Critical (<1ms)**: Performance threshold breaches requiring immediate response
- **High (<5ms)**: Optimization changes affecting real-time audio processing
- **Normal (<100ms)**: User guidance and browser compatibility notifications

### Audio Foundations Integration
[Source: Epic 003 Audio Foundations Complete]

**Performance Coordination Requirements:**
- **Audio Processing Optimization**: Browser optimizations must enhance, not interfere with audio latency
- **Device Manager Integration**: Browser capabilities must inform audio device selection
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimization changes must not disrupt active audio processing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Browser optimization effectiveness must be measurable through audio performance metrics

### Application Core Integration
[Source: Epic 002 Application Core Complete]

**Module Registry Integration:**
- **Configuration**: Browser optimization settings through Configuration Coordinator
- **Event Publishing**: All optimization events through TypedEventBus with proper priorities
- **Module Dependencies**: Browser optimization depends on Platform Abstraction completion
- **Performance Impact**: Browser optimizations must improve, not degrade, overall system performance

### Testing

Dev Note: Story requires the following tests:

- [ ] Rust Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 90%
- [ ] Rust Integration Tests: location: `src/modules/platform_abstraction/browser_optimization_tests.rs`
