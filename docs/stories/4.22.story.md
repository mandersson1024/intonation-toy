### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#web-audio-api]

**Web Audio API Integration Requirements:**
- **AudioContext Probing**: Test different sample rates (44100, 48000, 96000) and buffer sizes (1024-2048)
- **AudioWorklet Detection**: Verify AudioWorklet support and low-latency processing capabilities
- **Device Enumeration**: Use MediaDevices.enumerateDevices() for audio device capability assessment
- **Performance Testing**: Measure actual latency characteristics through roundtrip testing

**WebGL Capability Requirements:**
- **WebGL Context Testing**: Create contexts to test WebGL 1.0/2.0 support and extensions
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Detect GPU acceleration through renderer string analysis
- **Performance Profiling**: Measure graphics performance through standardized benchmark operations

### Technical Implementation Guidelines
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

**Device Capability Detection Architecture:**

pub struct AudioCapabilities {
    pub max_sample_rate: u32,
    pub min_sample_rate: u32,
    pub supported_buffer_sizes: Vec<u32>,
    pub max_channels: u8,
    pub supports_audio_worklet: bool,
    pub supports_echo_cancellation: bool,
    pub latency_characteristics: LatencyProfile,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct GraphicsCapabilities {
    pub webgl_version: Option<WebGLVersion>,
    pub supported_extensions: Vec<String>,
    pub max_texture_size: u32,
    pub hardware_accelerated: bool,
    pub renderer_info: String,
}

- **Detection Speed**: Complete capability assessment in <10ms
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ accuracy for capability detection across supported browsers
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Audio Foundations device manager
- **Monitoring**: Real-time capability change detection with minimal performance overhead

### Event Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 001 Event Bus Implementation]

**Capability Events to Publish:**
- **DeviceCapabilitiesDetected**: When initial capability detection is complete
- **CapabilityChangeDetected**: When device capabilities change during runtime
- **OptimalSettingsCalculated**: When optimal settings are determined from capabilities
- **HardwareAccelerationStatusChanged**: When hardware acceleration availability changes

**Event Priority Classifications:**
- **Critical (<1ms)**: Hardware acceleration changes affecting real-time audio processing
- **High (<5ms)**: Audio device capability changes requiring immediate optimization updates
- **Normal (<100ms)**: Graphics capability changes and optimal settings calculations

### Audio Foundations Integration
[Source: Epic 003 Audio Foundations Complete]

**Device Manager Coordination Requirements:**
- **Audio Device Integration**: Capability detection must enhance existing device manager with detailed capability information
- **Real-time Coordination**: Capability changes must coordinate with active audio processing without disruption
- **Performance Enhancement**: Detected capabilities must inform audio device selection and configuration
- **Capability Validation**: Audio device capabilities must be validated against detected system capabilities

### Platform Abstraction Integration
[Source: Story 4.20 - Platform Abstraction Module Foundation]

**Platform Module Dependencies:**
- **Browser Compatibility**: Capability detection must work with browser-specific optimization profiles
- **Optimization Engine**: Detected capabilities must feed into platform optimization engine
- **WebAssembly Bridge**: Capability detection requires WASM-JS boundary optimization awareness
- **Configuration**: Capability-based settings must integrate with configuration coordination system
