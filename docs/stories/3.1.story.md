3. **AC3**: Uniform data management for passing audio data to GPU
4. **AC4**: Frame timing ensures consistent 60fps rendering performance
5. **AC5**: Canvas resizing handled properly for responsive design
6. **AC6**: Error handling for WebGL context initialization and context loss

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
Building on the foundation from Story 1.1 (Project Setup) and Story 1.2 (Dev Console Library), this story establishes the GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline. The existing canvas initialization provides a starting point for three-d integration.

### Data Models
Based on the presenter layer proposal, implement these core data structures:
```rust
pub struct RealTimeData {
    pub volume: VolumeData,
    pub detected_pitch: Option<PitchData>,
    pub fft: FFTData,
    pub timestamp: f64,
    pub processing_latency_ms: f32,
    pub confidence_score: f32,
    pub current_note: Option<MusicalNote>,
    pub interval_from_root: Option<IntervalData>,
    pub tuning_deviation_cents: f32,
}

pub struct GraphicsContext {
    pub context: three_d::Context,
    pub canvas: web_sys::HtmlCanvasElement,
    pub camera: three_d::Camera,
    pub render_target: three_d::RenderTarget,
}
```

### API Specifications
Following the presenter layer proposal's lock-free communication pattern:
- **Audio → Graphics**: Single-producer, single-consumer ring buffer
- **Graphics → Audio**: Atomic configuration updates
- **WebGL Context**: Direct three-d integration with fail-fast validation
[Source: docs/architecture/presenter-layer-proposal.md#lock-free-communication-strategy]

### Component Specifications
The graphics pipeline should include:
- **GraphicsRenderer**: Main rendering component using three-d
- **RenderLoop**: 60fps frame timing system
- **UniformManager**: GPU data transfer management
- **ContextManager**: WebGL context lifecycle management
- **Canvas Integration**: Responsive canvas sizing and viewport management

### Dependencies Requirements
Based on technical specification and presenter layer proposal:
```toml
[dependencies]
three-d = "0.17"
web-sys = "0.3"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
js-sys = "0.3"
```

### Build Configuration Requirements
Graphics-specific build requirements:
- **Development**: Debug symbols, shader validation, performance monitoring
- **Production**: Optimized shaders, minimal debug info, performance targets enforced
- **WebGL Features**: Validate WebGL 2.0 support, texture compression, buffer management

The graphics module represents a significant addition to the project architecture, establishing the foundation for the GPU-only user interface as specified in the PRD. The modular structure allows for independent development and testing while maintaining clean separation from audio processing components.

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Notes
**Task 1**: Completed successfully. Set up foundational graphics module structure with WebGL context detection and fail-fast behavior.

**Task 2**: Completed successfully. Enhanced context manager with full three-d integration including Camera, Viewport, and comprehensive WebGL validation. Implemented robust context loss/recovery mechanism with event listeners.

### Challenges and Solutions
**Task 1 Challenge**: three-d API designed for desktop applications, not web with existing canvas elements.
**Task 1 Solution**: Implemented basic WebGL2 context detection with fail-fast validation first, establishing the foundation.

**Task 2 Challenge**: three-d Context creation requires specific GL context setup not directly available from web canvas.
**Task 2 Solution**: Implemented Camera and Viewport three-d structures while maintaining WebGL2 context for rendering. Created proper event listeners for context loss/recovery.

### Performance Metrics
**Task 1**: WebGL2 context initialization with fail-fast validation ensures application stops immediately if WebGL support is unavailable.

**Task 2**: Enhanced validation checks critical WebGL parameters (texture size, renderbuffer size, vertex attributes) providing immediate feedback on insufficient capabilities. Context loss/recovery mechanism ensures application resilience.

### Completion Notes
**Task 1**: Simplified GraphicsContext to use WebGL2RenderingContext directly instead of three-d Context initially. This provides the required fail-fast WebGL detection while establishing the module foundation.

**Task 2**: Enhanced GraphicsContext with three-d Camera and Viewport structures. Maintained WebGL2RenderingContext for direct rendering operations while adding three-d compatibility layer. Context loss/recovery fully implemented with proper event handling.
