- Enhanced audio buffer management built on Application Core BufferRef system
- Buffer pool and recycling system foundation established
- Data flow coordination between modules working
- Zero-copy audio data sharing mechanisms implemented

### Source Tree Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#modular-architecture]

**Implementation Target Files:**
- Buffer pool implementation: `src/modules/data_management/buffer_recycling_pool.rs`
- Pool metrics: `src/modules/data_management/pool_metrics.rs`
- WASM-JS boundary: `src/modules/data_management/wasm_js_bridge.rs`
- Pool optimization: `src/modules/data_management/pool_optimization.rs`
- Integration testing: `src/modules/data_management/integration_tests.rs`

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#data-management]

**Buffer Pool Performance Requirements:**
- **Allocation Speed**: <0.5ms for buffer allocation from pool
- **Memory Efficiency**: <3% overhead for pool management
- **Pool Hit Rate**: >90% buffer allocation from pool (not new allocation)
- **JS GC Pressure**: <10% reduction in JavaScript garbage collection pressure from audio buffer operations

**WebAssembly Integration:**
- **WASM↔JS Boundary**: Optimize buffer transfers across WASM-JavaScript boundary
- **Memory Management**: Use Rust Vec<f32> for internal processing with minimal GC impact
- **Zero-Copy**: Implement SharedArrayBuffer support where available for zero-copy sharing
- **Fallback**: Provide copy semantics fallback for browsers without SharedArrayBuffer support

### Technical Implementation Guidelines
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

**Buffer Pool Architecture:**
```rust
pub trait BufferRecyclingPool: Send + Sync {
    /// Get buffer from pool or create new one (Rust-side allocation)
    fn get_or_create(&mut self, size: usize) -> Result<Vec<f32>, PoolError>;
    
    /// Return buffer to pool for recycling
    fn recycle(&mut self, buffer: Vec<f32>) -> Result<(), PoolError>;
    
    /// Get JS-compatible buffer reference to minimize WASM↔JS boundary overhead
    fn get_js_buffer_ref(&mut self, size: usize) -> Result<JSBufferRef, PoolError>;
    
    /// Return JS buffer reference for recycling (reduces JS GC pressure)
    fn recycle_js_buffer_ref(&mut self, buffer_ref: JSBufferRef) -> Result<(), PoolError>;
    
    /// Get pool efficiency metrics
    fn get_efficiency_metrics(&self) -> PoolMetrics;
    
    /// Optimize pool sizes based on usage patterns
    fn optimize_pool_sizes(&mut self);
    
    /// Defragment pool to reduce memory fragmentation
    fn defragment(&mut self) -> DefragmentationResult;
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct PoolMetrics {
    pub total_allocations: u64,
    pub pool_hits: u64,
    pub pool_misses: u64,
    pub hit_rate_percentage: f32,
    pub memory_overhead_bytes: usize,
    pub fragmentation_percentage: f32,
    pub js_gc_pressure_reduction: f32, // Percentage reduction in JS GC pressure
    pub wasm_js_boundary_allocations: u64, // Cross-boundary allocations
}
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Buffer Allocation**: <0.5ms allocation time from pool
- **Memory Efficiency**: <3% overhead for pool management
- **Pool Hit Rate**: >90% allocation success from pool
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Data Management Module Foundation

### Event Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 001 Event Bus Implementation]

**Buffer Pool Events to Publish:**
- **BufferPoolAllocation**: When buffers are allocated from pool
- **BufferPoolRecycling**: When buffers are returned to pool for reuse
- **PoolOptimization**: When pool sizes are automatically adjusted
- **PoolFragmentation**: When fragmentation thresholds are exceeded
- **JSGCPressureReduction**: Metrics on JavaScript GC pressure reduction

**Event Priority Classifications:**
- **Critical (<0.5ms)**: Buffer allocation/recycling events affecting real-time audio processing
- **High (<5ms)**: Pool optimization events requiring immediate efficiency adjustments
- **Normal (<100ms)**: Pool metrics and monitoring events

### Data Management Module Integration
[Source: Epic 004 Story 023 Complete]

**BufferRef System Integration Requirements:**
- **Enhanced BufferRef**: Buffer pool must build on existing BufferRef system from Data Management Module
- **Pool Coordination**: Buffer allocation must integrate with existing AudioBufferManagerImpl
- **Module Registry**: Pool optimization must register with existing ModuleRegistry
- **Performance Enhancement**: Pool efficiency must enhance overall data management performance

### Audio Foundations Integration
[Source: Epic 003 Audio Foundations Complete]

**Real-time Processing Integration Requirements:**
- **Audio Thread Compatibility**: Buffer pool operations must be safe for real-time audio thread
- **Latency Constraints**: Pool allocation must meet <0.5ms allocation time for audio processing
- **Performance Enhancement**: Pool efficiency must improve overall audio processing performance
- **Event Coordination**: Pool events must coordinate with audio processing events
