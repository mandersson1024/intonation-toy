### Technical Implementation Guidelines

**Data Flow Coordinator Architecture:**
```rust
pub trait DataFlowCoordinator: Send + Sync {
    /// Register data flow pipeline between modules
    fn register_pipeline(&mut self, from: ModuleId, to: ModuleId, config: PipelineConfig) -> Result<PipelineId, FlowError>;
    
    /// Send data through registered pipeline
    fn send_data(&mut self, pipeline_id: PipelineId, data: FlowData) -> Result<(), FlowError>;
    
    /// Monitor data flow metrics
    fn get_flow_metrics(&self, pipeline_id: PipelineId) -> FlowMetrics;
    
    /// Handle backpressure situations
    fn handle_backpressure(&mut self, pipeline_id: PipelineId, strategy: BackpressureStrategy) -> Result<(), FlowError>;
    
    /// Transform data between module formats
    fn transform_data(&self, data: FlowData, from_format: DataFormat, to_format: DataFormat) -> Result<FlowData, TransformError>;
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FlowMetrics {
    pub throughput_ops_per_second: f32,
    pub average_latency_ms: f32,
    pub error_rate_percentage: f32,
    pub backpressure_events: u32,
    pub pipeline_health: PipelineHealth,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct PipelineConfig {
    pub buffer_size: usize,
    pub max_latency_ms: f32,
    pub priority: PipelinePriority,
    pub backpressure_strategy: BackpressureStrategy,
    pub transformation_required: bool,

### Event Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 001 Event Bus Implementation]

**Data Flow Events to Publish:**
- **PipelineRegistered**: When new data flow pipelines are established
- **DataFlowStarted**: When data begins flowing through pipelines
- **BackpressureDetected**: When flow control mechanisms activate
- **PipelineFailure**: When data flow pipelines experience failures
- **FlowRecovery**: When automatic recovery mechanisms succeed

**Event Priority Classifications:**
- **Critical (<1ms)**: Real-time audio data flow events affecting audio processing
- **High (<5ms)**: Pipeline health and backpressure events requiring immediate response
- **Normal (<100ms)**: Flow metrics and monitoring events

### Audio Foundations Integration
[Source: Epic 003 Audio Foundations Complete]

**Real-time Processing Integration Requirements:**
- **Audio Thread Compatibility**: Data flow operations must be safe for real-time audio thread
- **Latency Constraints**: Flow coordination must meet <2ms latency requirement for audio processing
- **Performance Enhancement**: Data flow efficiency must improve overall audio processing performance
- **Event Coordination**: Data flow events must coordinate with audio processing events

### Modular Architecture Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#module-interaction]

**Cross-Module Data Flow Requirements:**
- **Module Registry Integration**: Data flow coordinator must register with Application Core ModuleRegistry
- **Event Bus Integration**: All data flow coordination must use TypedEventBus from Application Core
- **Platform Optimization**: Data flow must leverage Platform Abstraction capabilities for browser-specific optimizations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Data flow metrics must integrate with Performance & Observability module
