# Story 2.1: Microphone Input and Audio Context

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a user,
I want the application to access my microphone for audio input,
so that I can use my voice or instrument for pitch detection.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: Application requests microphone permission using getUserMedia API
2. **AC2**: AudioContext initialized at appropriate sample rate (44.1kHz and 48kHz standard)
3. **AC3**: AudioWorklet processes incoming audio in real-time
4. **AC4**: Stream reconnection logic handles device disconnection/reconnection
5. **AC5**: Console commands for microphone status and manual permission requests
6. **AC6**: Error handling for permission denied and device unavailable states

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 successfully established the console module structure with DevCommand trait system, command registry, and proper development/production build separation. The modular architecture approach with conditional compilation worked well and should be followed for the audio module structure.
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.story.md Dev Agent Record section]

### Data Models
Audio system requires the following data structures:
- `MicrophoneState`: Enum for permission states (requesting, granted, denied, unavailable)
- `AudioStreamInfo`: Struct containing sample rate, buffer size, and device information
- `AudioError`: Error type for microphone and AudioContext failures
- `StreamReconnection`: State management for device reconnection logic
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Story 2.1 requirements]

### API Specifications
Web Audio API integration requirements:
- **getUserMedia API**: Request microphone access with appropriate constraints
- **AudioContext**: Initialize with preferred sample rates (44.1kHz, 48kHz standard)
- **AudioWorklet**: Real-time audio processing in dedicated thread
- **MediaDevices API**: Device enumeration and permission status
- **AudioDestinationNode**: Connect audio processing pipeline
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md Web Audio API section]

### Component Specifications
Audio module should include:
- **Microphone Manager**: Handle getUserMedia permissions and device access
- **Audio Context Manager**: AudioContext lifecycle and configuration
- **AudioWorklet Processor**: Real-time audio processing in dedicated thread
- **Stream Reconnection Handler**: Device disconnection/reconnection logic
- **Console Commands**: Integration with existing DevCommand system for microphone control
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management for audio failures

### File Locations
Based on the established modular architecture:
- **Main module**: `/src/modules/audio/mod.rs` - Audio module exports
- **Microphone handling**: `/src/modules/audio/microphone.rs` - getUserMedia and device management
- **Audio context**: `/src/modules/audio/context.rs` - AudioContext initialization and management
- **AudioWorklet**: `/src/modules/audio/worklet.rs` - Real-time audio processing
- **Stream management**: `/src/modules/audio/stream.rs` - Stream lifecycle and reconnection
- **Console integration**: Update `/src/modules/console/commands.rs` - Add microphone commands
- **Module registration**: Update `/src/modules/mod.rs` - Include audio module
- **App integration**: Update `/src/lib.rs` - Initialize audio system
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md planned modular structure]

### Testing Requirements
Following the phased testing strategy:
- **Phase 1 (Native Tests)**: Unit tests for audio data structures, error handling, and state management
- **Phase 2 (Future WASM Tests)**: AudioWorklet functionality and Web Audio API integration when WASM-specific functionality exists
- **Phase 3 (E2E Tests)**: Browser integration testing for microphone permissions and audio processing (later)
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md testing standards]

### Technical Constraints
- **Browser Compatibility**: Support Chrome 66+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+ with Web Audio API
- **Sample Rates**: 44.1kHz and 48kHz standard, 22.05kHz-96kHz for development testing
- **Buffer Sizes**: 1024 samples (production), 128-2048 samples (development)
- **AudioWorklet**: Fixed 128-sample processing chunks in dedicated thread
- **Secure Context**: HTTPS requirement for getUserMedia API
- **Performance**: Audio processing latency ≤30ms (production), ≤50ms (development)
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md audio processing stack and browser compatibility]

### Console Command Integration
Audio console commands to add to existing DevCommand system:
- `mic-status` - Show current microphone permission and device status
- `mic-request` - Manually request microphone permission
- `mic-reconnect` - Attempt to reconnect audio stream
- `audio-context` - Display AudioContext status and configuration
- `audio-devices` - List available audio input devices
[Source: PRD functional requirements FR5 and AC5]

### Error Handling Strategy
Audio-specific error handling:
- **Permission Denied**: Graceful fallback with user guidance
- **Device Unavailable**: Retry logic and user notification
- **Stream Interruption**: Automatic reconnection attempts
- **AudioContext Failure**: Context recreation and recovery
- **AudioWorklet Loading**: Fallback to ScriptProcessorNode if needed
