### Source Tree Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#modular-architecture]

**Implementation Target Files:**
- Module root: `src/modules/presentation_layer/mod.rs`
- UI Coordinator: `src/modules/presentation_layer/ui_coordinator.rs`
- Presentation Coordinator: `src/modules/presentation_layer/presentation_coordinator.rs`
- Debug overlay integration: `src/modules/presentation_layer/debug_overlay.rs`

- Future Graphics Foundations: `src/modules/graphics_foundations/` (Story 5.29)

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#presentation-layer]

**Presentation Layer Module Requirements:**
- **UI Coordination**: Manage coordination between HTML components and future immersive rendering
- **Debug Integration**: Seamless integration with conditionally compiled Developer UI module
- **Event System**: Route events between different UI systems (HTML, immersive, debug)
- **State Management**: Synchronize state across UI subsystems with minimal overhead
- **Performance**: Coordination layer overhead must be <1ms when debug disabled

**Module Architecture Pattern:**
```rust
pub trait UICoordinator: Send + Sync {
    fn render_immersive_ui(&mut self, state: &UIState) -> Result<(), RenderError>;
    #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
    fn render_debug_overlay(&mut self, debug_state: &DebugState) -> Result<(), RenderError>;
    #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
    fn toggle_debug_overlay(&mut self, visible: bool);
    fn handle_ui_event(&mut self, event: UIEvent) -> Result<(), UIError>;
    fn update_state(&mut self, state: UIState);
}

pub struct PresentationCoordinator {
    // STUB RENDERER - Will be replaced with wgpu renderer in Graphics Epic
    immersive_renderer: Box<dyn ImmersiveRenderer>,
    #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
    developer_ui: Option<crate::modules::developer_ui::DeveloperUI>,
    event_bus: Arc<dyn EventBus>,
}
```

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#yew-framework]

**Yew Framework Integration:**
- **Version**: Yew 0.21 for component-based debug UI coordination
- **Component Pattern**: Function components with hooks for state management in debug overlay
- **Conditional Compilation**: All Yew debug components must use `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`
- **Performance**: Debug overlay rendering must stay under 5ms to avoid interfering with future main UI

**Debug Integration Pattern:**
```rust
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
pub struct DebugOverlay {
    yew_app: App<DebugApp>,
    overlay_visible: bool,
    debug_components: Vec<Box<dyn DebugComponent>>,
}

#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
impl DebugOverlay {
    pub fn toggle_visibility(&mut self, visible: bool) {
        self.overlay_visible = visible;
        // Update debug UI visibility
    }
    
    pub fn update_debug_state(&mut self, state: &DebugState) {
        // Synchronize debug information
    }
}
```

### Conditional Compilation Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#development-tools]

**Debug Build Feature Flags:**
- Use `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` for automatic debug/release distinction throughout coordination layer
- Implement feature-based compilation for granular debug tool control
- Ensure complete debug system exclusion from production builds
- Support development-time feature toggling for debug overlay visibility

**Production Build Requirements:**
- **Zero Build Size Impact**: Debug overlay and coordination completely excluded from production WASM
- **Zero Runtime Impact**: No debug code paths or coordination overhead in production builds
- **Clean Separation**: No production code dependencies on debug overlay APIs

### Event System Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#application-core]

**Event Bus Integration:**
```rust
// Event types for UI coordination
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum UIEvent {
    UserInteraction(UserInteraction),
    StateUpdate(UIState),
    DebugToggle(bool),
    NoOp,
}

// Integration with Application Core event system
impl PresentationCoordinator {
    pub fn handle_ui_event(&mut self, event: UIEvent) -> Result<(), UIError> {
        match event {
            UIEvent::UserInteraction(interaction) => {
                self.immersive_renderer.handle_interaction(interaction)?;
            }
            UIEvent::StateUpdate(state) => {
                self.update_state(state);
            }
            #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
            UIEvent::DebugToggle(visible) => {
                if let Some(ref mut debug_ui) = self.developer_ui {
                    debug_ui.toggle_overlay(visible);
                }
            }
            UIEvent::NoOp => {}
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Module Registration Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#application-core]

**Application Core Integration:**
```rust
// Presentation Layer module registration
impl Module for PresentationLayerModule {
    fn initialize(&mut self) -> Result<(), ModuleError> {
        // Initialize UI coordinator
        self.ui_coordinator.initialize()?;
        
        // Register debug overlay (debug builds only)
        #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
        self.register_debug_overlay()?;
        
        // Connect to application event bus
        self.setup_event_integration()?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

**Coordination Performance Standards:**
- **UI Coordination Overhead**: Target <1ms, maximum 5ms when debug enabled
- **Debug Overlay Rendering**: Target <5ms, maximum 10ms to avoid main UI interference  
- **Event Routing Latency**: Target <1ms for UI responsiveness
- **State Synchronization**: Target <2ms for real-time debug information updates

**Memory Management:**
- Efficient state management using Rust ownership patterns
- Minimal heap allocations in coordination hot paths
- Debug overlay memory isolated from main application memory usage

## Testing

Unit Tests: `#[cfg(test)]` modules next to implementation, coverage requirement: 90%

Integration Tests: `src/modules/presentation_layer/integration_tests.rs`

Performance Tests: Validate coordination overhead <1ms requirement

Manual Test Steps:

1. Verify UI coordinator initializes successfully and integrates with Application Core
2. Test debug overlay toggle functionality in debug builds (should show/hide debug components)
3. Confirm production builds completely exclude debug overlay features
4. Test event routing between stub immersive renderer and debug overlay
5. Validate state synchronization between UI systems with real-time updates
6. Verify performance requirements through benchmark testing
7. Test integration with Developer UI module components from Story 5.26

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: 

### Debug Log References

[[LLM: (Dev Agent) If the debug is logged to during the current story progress, create a table with the debug log and the specific task section in the debug log - do not repeat all the details in the story]]

### Completion Notes List

- **Thread Safety Adjustment**: Removed Send + Sync requirements from UI traits (UICoordinator, ImmersiveRenderer, EventHandler) as they are not needed in the WASM single-threaded context and were causing compilation issues with Rc<RefCell<T>> patterns.

- **Error Type Simplification**: Replaced ModuleError usage in developer_ui with Box<dyn std::error::Error> since ModuleError is not yet defined in the application core. This provides a compatible error handling approach while maintaining flexibility.

- **Conditional Compilation**: Successfully implemented #[cfg(debug_assertions)] throughout all debug overlay components, ensuring complete exclusion from production builds with zero runtime impact.

- **Architecture Foundation Ready**: UI coordination architecture is fully implemented and ready for Graphics Foundations integration in future stories. The StubImmersiveRenderer provides a complete testing interface for coordination validation.
