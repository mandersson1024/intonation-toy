## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1-2.3 have established the audio processing pipeline with AudioWorklet, circular buffers, and event dispatching. Volume detection builds on this foundation by adding RMS/peak analysis to the existing buffer processing workflow.

### Data Models
Volume detection requires these data structures:
- `VolumeDetector` struct for processing configuration and state
- `VolumeLevel` enum for classification (Silent, Low, Optimal, High, Clipping)
- `VolumeAnalysis` struct for calculation results
- Extension to `AudioEvent` enum for volume events

### API Specifications
Volume detection integrates with existing audio processing APIs:
- **AudioWorklet integration**: Extend existing worklet for volume analysis
- **Event Dispatcher**: Publish VolumeChanged and VolumeWarning events
- **Console Commands**: Add volume configuration and monitoring commands
