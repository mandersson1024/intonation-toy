## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#audio-processing-layer]

- **Audio Module Location**: `src/modules/audio_foundations/` 
- **Event Definitions**: `src/modules/audio_foundations/audio_events.rs` (already exists)
- **Integration Point**: AudioFoundationsModule implements event publishing
- **Event Bus Integration**: Uses TypedEventBus from `src/modules/application_core/`

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#webassembly]

- **Performance Target**: Event publishing <1ms for critical events
- **WebAssembly Constraints**: Minimize allocations in event publishing hot path
- **JavaScript Interop**: Events must be efficiently serializable for JS consumption
- **Real-time Audio**: Event publishing cannot affect <10ms audio processing latency

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/epic-003-audio-foundations-stories.md Story 017]

**Key Integration Points from Previous Stories:**
- Story 013: `AudioFoundationsModule` wrapper provides event bus access via `self.event_bus`
- Story 014: Device events already defined in `audio_events.rs`, need integration
- Story 015: Pitch detection events partially implemented, need completion  
- Story 017: Performance monitoring events defined, need event bus publishing

**Event Publishing Pattern Established:**
```rust
// From Story 013 implementation pattern:
impl AudioFoundationsModule {
    fn publish_critical_event<T: Event>(&self, event: T) {
        self.event_bus.publish_critical(event);
    }
}
```

### Event Bus Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 001 implementation]

- **Event Bus Interface**: Uses `TypedEventBus` with priority-based publishing
- **Event Priorities**: Critical (<1ms), High (<5ms), Normal (<100ms), Low (best effort)
- **Type Safety**: All events must implement `Event` trait with proper serialization
- **Performance**: Zero-copy event publishing for audio processing events

### Technical Implementation Details

**Event Categories and Priorities:**
1. **Critical Events** (publish_critical): Pitch detection results, audio dropouts
2. **High Priority** (publish_high): Device state changes, error events  
3. **Normal Priority** (publish_normal): Performance metrics, educational events
4. **Low Priority** (publish_low): Batched statistics, debug information

**Event Publishing Interface:**
```rust
// Audio Foundation publishes these event types:
impl AudioFoundationsModule {
    fn publish_pitch_detected(&self, result: PitchResult) {
        let event = PitchDetectionEvent {
            frequency: result.frequency,
            confidence: result.confidence,
            signal_info: SignalInfo::from(result),
            processing_time_ns: result.processing_time_ns,
            timestamp_ns: get_timestamp(),
            source_buffer_ref: self.current_buffer_ref,
        };
        self.event_bus.publish_critical(event);
    }
    
    fn publish_device_state(&self, device_id: &str, state: DeviceState) {
        let event = MicrophoneStateEvent {
            state,
            device_info: self.get_device_info(device_id),
            permissions: self.current_permissions,
            timestamp_ns: get_timestamp(),
        };
        self.event_bus.publish_high(event);
    }
}
```

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Rust Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 90%
- [ ] Integration Test (Test Location): location: `src/modules/audio_foundations/event_integration_tests.rs`
- [ ] Manual Test: Audio event dashboard to verify real-time event publishing

Manual Test Steps:

- Dev will create integration test that demonstrates all event types being published correctly to event bus
- Dev will verify event publishing latency meets performance requirements (<1ms critical, <5ms high priority)
- Dev will test event batching system reduces non-critical event load by >50%
- Dev will validate error events include proper context and recovery suggestions
