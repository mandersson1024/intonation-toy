**Epic**: EP-002 Browser Audio Integration & Permissions  
**Story ID**: 2.3  
**Story Type**: Technical Foundation  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Foundation)  
**Estimated Effort**: 3 story points  
**Sprint**: TBD  

**Dependencies**: 
- ✅ Story 2.1 (Permission flow foundation)

## Story Description

**As a** user attempting to use the pitch visualizer  
**I want** clear guidance and graceful fallbacks when my browser doesn't support required features or encounters errors  
**So that** I understand what's happening and have alternative ways to experience the application even when full functionality isn't available.

### Background Context

With Stories 2.1 and 2.2 complete, we have a functional real-time audio processing pipeline. However, we need comprehensive error handling for:
- Browsers that don't support Web Audio API or AudioWorklets
- Microphone permission denied scenarios beyond the basic modal
- Audio context initialization failures
- WASM loading or execution errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Hardware-specific audio problems

This story completes EP-002 by ensuring the application works gracefully across all target browsers and error conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Unsupported Browser Detection and Fallback
**Given** a user visits the application in an unsupported browser  
**When** the browser lacks Web Audio API, AudioWorklets, or WASM support  
**Then** the application displays a clear message explaining the limitations and provides alternative experiences

**Technical Details**:
- Detect missing: WebAssembly, AudioContext, AudioWorklet, getUserMedia
- Show browser-specific upgrade recommendations
- Provide demo mode with pre-recorded audio samples
- Maintain core WASM testing functionality where possible

### AC2: Enhanced Microphone Permission Error Handling
**Given** a user denies microphone permission or encounters microphone errors  
**When** permission is denied, device is in use, or hardware errors occur  
**Then** the application provides specific guidance and fallback options

**Technical Details**:
- Handle NotAllowedError, NotFoundError, NotReadableError, OverconstrainedError
- Provide device-specific troubleshooting steps
- Offer demo mode with synthetic audio
- Allow retry with different audio constraints

### AC3: Audio Context Error Recovery
**Given** the Web Audio API encounters initialization or runtime errors  
**When** audio context fails to start, suspend, or process audio  
**Then** the application attempts recovery and provides clear error messages

**Technical Details**:
- Handle audio context state changes and errors
- Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Detect and handle audio device changes
- Provide manual recovery options

### AC4: WASM Error Handling and Clear Messaging
**Given** the WASM module fails to load or execute  
**When** WASM compilation, instantiation, or runtime errors occur  
**Then** the application provides clear messaging that WASM is required and directs users to supported browsers

**Technical Details**:
- Detect WASM loading failures and show browser upgrade guidance
- Handle WASM runtime errors gracefully with clear error messages
- Provide list of supported browsers with WASM capability
- No JavaScript fallback - WASM is a hard requirement

### AC5: Network and Loading Error Handling
**Given** network connectivity issues or resource loading failures  
**When** WASM files, audio worklets, or other resources fail to load  
**Then** the application provides offline capabilities and retry mechanisms

**Technical Details**:
- Implement service worker for offline functionality
- Provide retry mechanisms with user feedback
- Cache critical resources for offline use
- Graceful degradation when resources unavailable

### AC6: Comprehensive Error Reporting and User Guidance
**Given** any error condition occurs in the application  
**When** the user encounters problems  
**Then** they receive actionable guidance and can report issues

**Technical Details**:
- Centralized error logging and user-friendly error messages
- Step-by-step troubleshooting guides
- Browser/device capability detection and recommendations
- Optional error reporting mechanism
