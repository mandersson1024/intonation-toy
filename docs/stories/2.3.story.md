# Story 2.3: YIN Pitch Detection Implementation

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a user,
I want accurate pitch detection from my audio input,
so that I can see my voice or instrument's pitch in real-time with confidence scoring.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: YIN algorithm implementation using pitch-detection crate
2. **AC2**: Pitch detection operates on configurable sample windows
3. **AC3**: Frequency output with confidence score (0.0-1.0 range)
4. **AC4**: Musical note mapping from frequency to note names and octaves
5. **AC5**: Processing latency meets performance requirements (≤200ms production)
6. **AC6**: Support for multiple tuning systems as specified
7. **AC7**: Pitch detection publishes **PitchEvents** (e.g., `PitchDetectedEvent`, `PitchLostEvent`, `PitchConfidenceEvent`) through the central **Event Dispatcher** for consumption by visualization, audio processing, and debugging modules

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Context
Stories 2.1 and 2.2 successfully established the core audio infrastructure:
- **Story 2.1**: AudioContext initialization, microphone manager, AudioWorklet processor, stream management, and console commands
- **Story 2.2**: Audio buffer management system with CircularBuffer, BufferAnalyzer, BufferPool, and event-driven architecture

The audio module structure is established at `/src/audio/` with:
- Real-time audio processing via AudioWorklet with fixed 128-sample chunks
- Buffer management with sequential analysis (no overlap) using BufferAnalyzer
- Event-driven architecture with BufferEvents published through Event Dispatcher
- Console command integration for debugging and monitoring
- Zero-allocation processing during steady-state operation

### Data Models

Pitch detection system requires the following data structures:

```rust
/// Pitch detection result with frequency and confidence
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct PitchResult {
    pub frequency: f32,        // Hz
    pub confidence: f32,       // 0.0-1.0 range
    pub timestamp: f64,        // High-resolution timestamp
    pub clarity: f32,          // YIN clarity metric
}

/// Musical note representation
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct MusicalNote {
    pub note: NoteName,        // C, D, E, F, G, A, B
    pub octave: i32,           // MIDI octave number
    pub cents: f32,            // Deviation from equal temperament in cents
    pub frequency: f32,        // Exact frequency in Hz
}

/// Note names enumeration
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum NoteName {
    C, CSharp, D, DSharp, E, F, FSharp, G, GSharp, A, ASharp, B
}

/// Tuning system specification
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum TuningSystem {
    EqualTemperament { reference_pitch: f32 },      // A4 = 440Hz standard
    JustIntonation { reference_pitch: f32 },        // Pure intervals
    Custom { frequency_ratios: Vec<f32> },          // User-defined ratios
}

/// Pitch detector configuration
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct PitchDetectorConfig {
    pub sample_window_size: usize,     // Samples for analysis (multiple of 128)
    pub threshold: f32,                // Minimum confidence threshold
    pub tuning_system: TuningSystem,   // Active tuning system
    pub min_frequency: f32,            // Minimum detectable frequency (Hz)
    pub max_frequency: f32,            // Maximum detectable frequency (Hz)
}
```

- **Phase 3 (E2E Tests)**: End-to-end pitch detection with visualization updates

### Console Command Integration

Pitch detection console commands to add to existing DevCommand system:

### Event System Integration

Pitch detection MUST integrate with the project-wide **event-driven architecture**:
- Publish strongly-typed **PitchEvents** via the central **Event Dispatcher**
- Subscribe to **BufferEvents** for real-time audio data processing
- Ensure zero-allocation event publishing on hot paths (audio processing thread)
- Support event-driven visualization updates without polling

Required PitchEvent variants:
```rust
/// Pitch detection events
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum PitchEvent {
    /// Pitch successfully detected
    PitchDetected {
        frequency: f32,
        confidence: f32,
        note: MusicalNote,
        clarity: f32,
        timestamp: f64,
    },
    /// Pitch detection lost (below threshold)
    PitchLost {
        last_frequency: f32,
        timestamp: f64,
    },
    /// Confidence level changed significantly
    ConfidenceChanged {
        frequency: f32,
        confidence: f32,
        timestamp: f64,
    },
    /// Tuning system changed
    TuningSystemChanged {
        system: TuningSystem,
        timestamp: f64,
    },
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

Pitch detection specific error handling:
- **Algorithm Failure**: Graceful fallback with confidence scoring
- **Invalid Frequency**: Range validation with user feedback
- **Performance Degradation**: Adaptive window sizing based on performance
