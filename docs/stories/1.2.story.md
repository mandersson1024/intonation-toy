# Story 1.2: Implement pitch detection algorithms in Rust and compile to WASM with proper JS bindings

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a **music student**
- I want **the application to accurately detect the pitch of my instrument in real-time**
- so that **I can receive immediate feedback on my musical performance**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: Pitch detection algorithms (YIN, McLeod) implemented in Rust using pitch_detection crate
2. **AC2**: Algorithms compiled to WASM with proper wasm-bindgen exports for JavaScript integration
3. **AC3**: WASM pitch detection functions callable from JavaScript with frequency output in Hz
4. **AC4**: Pitch detection accuracy within ±5 cents for musical notes in practical range (80Hz-2000Hz)
5. **AC5**: Processing latency maintains <50ms target with buffer sizes 1024-2048 samples

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1, key learnings for this story:
- WASM compilation pipeline is working correctly with wasm-pack 0.12
- pitch_detection crate version 0.3 is confirmed compatible (not 0.4 as originally planned)
- Professional browser test suite infrastructure is available at http://localhost:8080/web/
- Enhanced testing standards established with performance monitoring capability

### Technical Guidance from Architecture Documents

**Technology Stack**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Dependencies]
- **WASM Compilation**: wasm-pack 0.12 (Rust to WebAssembly toolchain)
- **WASM Runtime**: wasm-bindgen 0.2 (Rust/WASM ↔ JavaScript bridge)
- **Pitch Detection**: pitch_detection 0.3 (Autocorrelation algorithms - YIN, McLeod)

**Performance Constraints**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Constraints]
- **Audio Latency**: <50ms total (web audio constraints)
- **Buffer Size**: 1024-2048 samples (larger buffers for web stability)
- **Processing Budget**: <70% of AudioWorklet quantum for processing
- **Memory**: Minimal allocations, leverage WASM memory efficiency

**Project Structure**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Module Responsibilities]
```
src/audio/
├── mod.rs             # Audio module exports (update with pitch detection exports)
├── engine.rs          # Core audio engine (integrate pitch detection)
├── pitch_detector.rs  # NEW: Pitch detection algorithms (YIN, McLeod)
└── interval_calc.rs   # Musical interval calculations (future story)
```

**File Locations**: Exact paths where new code should be created:
- Primary implementation: `src/audio/pitch_detector.rs`
- Integration point: `src/audio/engine.rs` (update existing)
- Module exports: `src/audio/mod.rs` (update existing)
- WASM entry point: `src/lib.rs` (add pitch detection exports)

**Testing Requirements**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]
- 80% code coverage minimum for all Rust code
- Tests located next to source files (`nextToFile: true`)
- Integration testing via enhanced browser test suite
- Performance benchmarking with established thresholds

**Technical Constraints**: 
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Browser Compatibility]
- **Pitch Accuracy**: ±5 cents for musical note identification [Source: epic-backlog.md#EP-001]
- **Frequency Range**: 80Hz-2000Hz (practical musical instrument range)

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Cargo Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80% [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]
- [ ] Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/tests/wasm-integration/pitch-detection.spec.js` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration Tests]
- [ ] Browser Test Suite: Enhanced test suite integration at http://localhost:8080/web/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Interactive Browser Test Suite]

Manual Test Steps:
- Run `./dev.sh` to build WASM and start development server
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/web/ for comprehensive test suite
- Use TestFramework to validate pitch detection accuracy with known frequencies
- Test performance benchmarks ensure <50ms processing latency
- Validate cross-browser compatibility with pitch detection functions
