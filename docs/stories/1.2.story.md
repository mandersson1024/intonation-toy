# Story 1.2: Development Console Component

## Metadata
- **Epic**: 1 - Foundation & Development Infrastructure
- **Story Number**: 1.2
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.1 (Done)
- **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

## Story

As a developer,
I want an interactive development console within the application,
so that I can debug audio processing, test features, and monitor application state.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: DevConsole Yew component renders as toggleable overlay
2. **AC2**: Command input field accepts and executes commands through DevCommand trait
3. **AC3**: Command history maintained with navigation support
4. **AC4**: Built-in help command displays available commands and usage
5. **AC5**: Console output displays command results and error messages
6. **AC6**: Console only available in development builds, hidden in production

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 successfully established the Yew framework foundation with proper build configuration and modular structure. The YAGNI principle was correctly applied with TODO comments for future modules. The phased testing strategy is in place with native tests working well.

### Data Models
Console system requires the following data structures:
- `ConsoleCommand`: Struct for command input parsing and execution
- `ConsoleOutput`: Enum for different output types (info, error, success, debug)
- `ConsoleHistory`: Vec-based command history with navigation state
- `DevCommand`: Trait for extensible command system

### API Specifications
No external API specifications required for this story. The console interfaces with:
- Internal command system through DevCommand trait
- Browser console API for logging fallback
- Local storage API for command history persistence (optional)
[Source: PRD functional requirements FR5]

### Component Specifications
DevConsole Yew component should include:
- **Toggleable overlay**: CSS-based modal overlay that can be shown/hidden
- **Command input field**: HTML input element with command parsing
- **Output display area**: Scrollable div for command results
- **Command history navigation**: Up/Down arrow key support
- **Help system**: Built-in help command with command documentation
- **Development-only compilation**: Conditional compilation for development builds
[Source: PRD UI design goals - HTML/CSS allowed for development tools]

### File Locations
Based on the established modular architecture:
- **Main component**: `/src/modules/console/component.rs` - DevConsole Yew component
- **Command system**: `/src/modules/console/commands.rs` - DevCommand trait and implementations
- **History management**: `/src/modules/console/history.rs` - Command history functionality
- **Output formatting**: `/src/modules/console/output.rs` - Console output handling
- **Module exports**: `/src/modules/console/mod.rs` - Console module organization
- **Integration**: Update `/src/lib.rs` to include console in development builds
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md console module structure]

### Testing Requirements
Following the phased testing strategy:
- **Phase 1 (Native Tests)**: Unit tests for command parsing, history management, and output formatting
- **Phase 2 (Future WASM Tests)**: Component integration tests when WASM-specific functionality is added
- **Phase 3 (E2E Tests)**: Console interaction testing via browser automation (later)
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md testing standards]

### Technical Constraints
- **Development-only compilation**: Use `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` for development builds
- **CSS styling**: Limited to console component only, following UI architecture constraint
- **Performance**: Console operations should not affect audio processing performance
- **Memory usage**: Command history should have reasonable limits to prevent memory leaks
- **Browser compatibility**: Console must work across all supported browsers (Chrome 66+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+)
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md browser compatibility and PRD performance requirements]

### Console Command Architecture
DevCommand trait pattern for extensible command system:
```rust
pub trait DevCommand {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn description(&self) -> &str;
    fn execute(&self, args: Vec<&str>) -> ConsoleOutput;
}
```
Initial built-in commands:
- `help` - Display available commands and usage
- `clear` - Clear console output
- `status` - Show application status
[Source: PRD functional requirements FR5 and FR10]

### Build Configuration Requirements
Development console should be:
- **Included in development builds**: Accessible via keyboard shortcut or menu
- **Excluded from production builds**: Compiled out entirely using conditional compilation
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS or embedded CSS for console appearance
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Standard developer console shortcuts (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, etc.)

## Project Structure Notes

The console module aligns perfectly with the planned modular architecture in `/src/modules/console/`. This follows the established pattern from Story 1.1 and maintains the YAGNI principle by implementing only what's needed for the current development console requirements.

## Deviation Analysis

No significant deviations between epic requirements and architecture constraints identified. The story maintains the HTML/CSS restriction to development tools only, as specified in the UI architecture constraints.

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Cargo Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] WASM Integration Tests: location: `/tests-wasm/unit/console_functionality.rs` (Phase 2 - when WASM-specific functionality exists)
- [ ] E2E Tests: location: `/e2e/development-tools/console.test.ts` (Phase 3 - browser integration)

Manual Test Steps:
- Run development build with `trunk serve`
- Toggle console visibility using keyboard shortcut or UI element
- Test command input and execution with built-in commands (`help`, `clear`, `status`)
- Verify command history navigation with up/down arrow keys
- Confirm console output displays properly for different message types
- Validate console is not included in production builds
