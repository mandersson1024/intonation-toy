## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/5.30.story.md - Developer UI Event Integration Complete]

**Key Context from Story 5.30:**
- Developer UI event system fully integrated with comprehensive event subscription hooks
- Type-safe event handling implemented with compile-time verification
- Event subscription cleanup and memory leak prevention working
- Performance monitoring shows <1ms event subscription/unsubscription
- All debug components (AudioControlPanel, DebugPanel, MetricsDisplay, MicrophonePermission, TestSignalGenerator) now event-driven

- Conditional compilation for debug features working correctly

**Implementation Notes from Previous Story:**
- Event system integration uses custom `use_event_subscription` hooks for Yew components

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/modular-restructure-architecture.md#module-interaction]

**Integration Testing Architecture Requirements:**
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum test coverage for developer UI module and immersive UI coordination
- **Performance**: Debug UI tests complete in <30 seconds, zero impact on production builds
- **Conditional Compilation**: Verify debug features completely excluded from production
- **Automation**: Integrated with existing CI/CD pipeline with production build verification

**Module Integration Patterns:**
```rust
// Integration test structure for UI coordination
#[cfg(test)]
mod ui_coordinator_integration_tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[wasm_bindgen_test]
    async fn test_debug_overlay_coordination() {
        let ui_coordinator = PresentationCoordinator::new();
        let debug_overlay = create_debug_overlay().await;
        
        // Test debug overlay rendering coordination
        ui_coordinator.render_debug_overlay(&debug_state).await?;
        assert!(debug_overlay.is_rendered());
        
        // Test toggle functionality
        ui_coordinator.toggle_debug_overlay(false);
        assert!(!debug_overlay.is_visible());
    }
}

// Performance regression test pattern
#[test]
fn test_production_build_debug_exclusion() {
    #[cfg(not(debug_assertions))]
    {
        // Verify debug code is completely excluded
        assert!(!has_debug_symbols());
        assert_eq!(get_debug_module_size(), 0);
    }
}
```

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-framework]

**Testing Framework Integration:**

- **Integration Testing**: Custom test infrastructure with `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- **Performance Testing**: Custom stress testing framework and benchmark suite
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Manual and automated browser compatibility validation

**Test Execution Requirements:**
```rust
// Integration test performance requirements
pub struct IntegrationTestConfig {
    pub max_execution_time_seconds: u32,     // 30 seconds max
    pub coverage_requirement_percent: u8,    // 80% minimum
    pub debug_impact_tolerance_percent: u8,  // 0% impact allowed
    pub production_size_increase_max_kb: u32, // 0 KB increase allowed
}

// Wasm integration test pattern
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
async fn test_developer_ui_event_integration() {
    let app = create_test_app_with_debug().await;
    let debug_overlay = app.get_developer_ui().await;
    
    // Test real-time event updates
    app.publish_audio_event(AudioEvent::PitchDetected { /* ... */ }).await;
    
    // Verify component receives and displays update
    let metrics_display = debug_overlay.find_component::<MetricsDisplay>().await;
    assert!(metrics_display.received_pitch_event().await);
    assert!(metrics_display.is_displaying_updated_metrics().await);
}
```
