## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Context
[Source: docs/stories/3.18.story.md - Audio Event Publishing Integration]

**Key Context from Previous Story:**
- Story 3.18 completed comprehensive audio event publishing integration with TypedEventBus
- All audio modules now publish events for real-time monitoring and debugging
- Event publishing performance validated at <1ms for critical events
- Integration tests already exist in `src/modules/audio_foundations/event_integration_tests.rs`
- Performance monitoring system provides comprehensive metrics collection

### Source Tree Context
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#audio-processing-layer]

**Audio Module Location**: `src/modules/audio_foundations/`
**Key Files for Testing:**
- Core implementations: `multi_algorithm_pitch_detector.rs`, `device_manager.rs`, `signal_generator.rs`, `audio_performance_monitor.rs`
- Existing test files: `*_tests.rs` files alongside implementations
- Integration tests: `event_integration_tests.rs`, `multi_algorithm_integration_tests.rs`
- Test infrastructure: `test_signal_library.rs`, `stress_tester.rs`

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#webassembly]

**Testing Technology Stack:**
- **Core Testing Framework**: Native Rust testing with `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- **WebAssembly Testing**: `wasm-bindgen-test` for browser environment validation  
- **Performance Testing**: Custom stress testing framework in `stress_tester.rs`
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Manual testing procedures with automated verification scripts

### Testing Strategy Context
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-layers]

**Coverage Requirements:**
- **Unit Test Coverage**: 90% target, 80% minimum threshold
- **Integration Test Coverage**: 85% target, 75% minimum threshold
- **Performance Requirements**: <10ms audio processing latency, <1ms event publishing
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Chrome 69+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+

**Test Infrastructure Patterns:**
```rust
// Unit test structure pattern
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_pitch_detection_accuracy() {
        let detector = MultiAlgorithmPitchDetector::new(config, None).unwrap();
        let test_signal = generate_sine_wave(440.0, 44100.0, 1024, 0.5);
        let result = detector.detect_pitch(&test_signal).unwrap();
        assert_frequency_within_tolerance(result.frequency, 440.0, 0.1);
    }
}
```

**Performance Test Requirements:**
- Target latency: <5ms pitch detection, <10ms maximum
- Event publishing: <1ms critical events, <5ms high priority
- Memory usage: <10MB audio buffers, <50MB maximum
- Throughput: 1000+ events/second sustained processing

### Audio Processing Context
[Source: Epic 3 Implementation History]

**Existing Test Infrastructure:**
- `TestSignalGenerator` in `signal_generator.rs` provides comprehensive waveform generation
- `StressTester` in `stress_tester.rs` includes performance and memory leak detection
- `AudioPerformanceMonitor` provides real-time metrics for validation
- Mock audio device framework already exists in `device_manager.rs` with feature flag `mock-audio`

**Key Performance Metrics to Validate:**
- End-to-end audio latency: <10ms target
- Pitch detection accuracy: â‰¥95% for pure tones
- Algorithm switching overhead: <1ms
- Event publishing latency: <1ms for critical events
- Memory usage stability over 1+ hour sessions

### Testing

Dev Note: Story requires the following tests:

- [x] Rust Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 90%
- [x] Rust Integration Tests: location: `src/modules/audio_foundations/*_integration_tests.rs`
- [ ] Manual Cross-Browser Tests: location: `tests/manual-testing/browser-compatibility-validation.md`
- [ ] Performance Regression Tests: location: `src/modules/audio_foundations/performance_regression_tests.rs`

Manual Test Steps:

- Dev will create comprehensive test suite with >90% code coverage for all audio foundations components
- Dev will implement automated performance regression detection comparing against baseline metrics
- Dev will create cross-browser compatibility validation procedures for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Dev will validate memory leak detection over 1+ hour sustained audio processing sessions
- Dev will test error recovery scenarios including device failures and permission changes
