### Technical Guidance from Architecture Documents

**Testing Strategy**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: 80% minimum coverage, nextToFile placement
- **Integration Tests**: Browser-based testing with Jest framework
- **Performance Tests**: <50ms latency requirement, throughput benchmarks
- **Cross-browser Tests**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge validation

**Performance Constraints**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Constraints]
- **Audio Latency**: <50ms total (web audio constraints)
- **Buffer Size**: 1024-2048 samples (larger buffers for web stability)
- **Processing Budget**: <70% of AudioWorklet quantum for processing
