## Story Estimation Framework

### **Complexity Factors (Post Story 1.1 Standards)**

**Testing Overhead** (Now Standard):
- Professional browser test suite validation: **Included in base estimate**
- Performance benchmarking: **Included in base estimate** 
- Cross-browser testing: **Included in base estimate**
- Documentation updates: **Included in base estimate**

**Technical Complexity Multipliers:**
- **Simple** (1x): Follows established patterns, minimal risk
- **Moderate** (1.5x): New patterns, moderate integration complexity
- **Complex** (2x): High technical risk, significant architecture impact

**Quality Standards Impact:**
- All stories must meet enhanced Definition of Done
- Performance thresholds must be validated
- Browser test suite must pass before story completion
