# Debug Signal Generator Implementation Plan

## Overview

The TestSignalGenerator is a critical debugging component that generates synthetic audio signals and **routes them through the pitch detection pipeline as a substitute for microphone input**. This component enables developers to validate pitch detection, frequency analysis, and performance monitoring with known test signals instead of requiring external audio input.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Signal Generation**: Generate standard waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)
2. **Frequency Control**: Precise frequency selection (20Hz - 20kHz range)
3. **Pipeline Integration**: Route generated signals through the existing audio processing pipeline
4. **Pitch Detection Testing**: Validate pitch detector accuracy with known frequencies
5. **Real-time Control**: Start/stop signal generation with immediate pipeline integration
6. **Audio Inspector Integration**: Generated signals should appear in audio inspector for verification
7. **Performance Testing**: Test audio engine performance with controlled signals

### Technical Requirements
1. **Performance**: Low-latency signal generation (<5ms)
2. **Accuracy**: Frequency accuracy within Â±1Hz for pitch detection validation
3. **Pipeline Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing AudioEngineService
4. **Quality**: Clean signals with minimal artifacts for accurate testing
5. **Stream Substitution**: Replace microphone MediaStream with generated signals
