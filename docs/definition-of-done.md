# Definition of Done
## Real-time Pitch Visualizer

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: June 2025  
**Last Updated**: Post Story 1.1 completion  
**Purpose**: Define quality standards and completion criteria for all stories

---

## Overview

This Definition of Done establishes the quality gates that must be met before any story can be considered complete. These standards ensure consistent quality, maintainability, and user value across all deliverables.

**Scope**: Applies to all user stories, technical tasks, and architectural work within the pitch-toy project.

  - ⚠️ **Acceptable**: < 500μs per buffer processing
  - ❌ **Needs Optimization**: > 500μs per buffer processing
- [ ] **Stress Testing**: 1000+ iteration validation passes
- [ ] **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- [ ] **Real-time Metrics**: Performance monitoring shows no regressions

### ✅ **Manual Testing (Required)**
- [ ] Development workflow tested (`./dev.sh` works correctly)
- [ ] Cross-browser functionality validation
- [ ] User experience testing on target devices
- [ ] Performance validation meets targets

---

## Performance Standards

### ✅ **Audio Processing Performance**

- [ ] **Processing Time**: Meets browser test suite thresholds
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: < 100MB total application memory
- [ ] **CPU Usage**: < 50% single core during normal operation

### ✅ **Web Performance**
- [ ] **Initial Load**: < 2s on broadband connection
- [ ] **WASM Load Time**: < 500ms initialization
- [ ] **UI Responsiveness**: 60 FPS maintained during audio processing
- [ ] **Mobile Performance**: Acceptable performance on target devices

---

## User Experience Standards

### ✅ **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria explicitly validated
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Loading states provide appropriate feedback
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop, tablet, mobile

### ✅ **Accessibility Standards**
- [ ] Keyboard navigation functional
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility (basic level)
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Text scaling supports 200% zoom

### ✅ **Browser Compatibility**
- [ ] **Chrome 90+**: Full functionality
- [ ] **Firefox 88+**: Full functionality  
- [ ] **Safari 14+**: Full functionality
- [ ] **Edge 90+**: Full functionality
- [ ] Feature detection and graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

---

## Documentation Standards

- [ ] Relevant architecture documents updated
- [ ] New patterns documented in `/docs/architecture/`
- [ ] Breaking changes documented with migration notes
- [ ] Performance impacts documented

### ✅ **Story Documentation**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria explicitly marked as complete
- [ ] Testing section updated with actual test results
- [ ] Dev notes include references to architecture documents
- [ ] Completion notes document any scope changes or enhancements

### ✅ **User Documentation**
- [ ] README.md updated with new functionality
- [ ] Development setup instructions verified
- [ ] Known issues documented

---

## Development Workflow Standards

### ✅ **Build and Deployment**
- [ ] **Clean Build**: `wasm-pack build` succeeds without warnings
- [ ] **Development Server**: `./dev.sh` works reliably
- [ ] **Port Management**: Consistent port 8080 usage
- [ ] **Generated Files**: pkg/ directory properly created

### ✅ **Code Review Standards**
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] No hardcoded values without justification
- [ ] Performance implications considered and documented
- [ ] Security implications reviewed (if applicable)

### ✅ **Version Control**
- [ ] Commit messages clearly describe changes
- [ ] No temporary files or debug code committed
- [ ] Proper .gitignore patterns maintained

## Quality Gates

### ✅ **Before Story Completion**
1. **All Acceptance Criteria Validated**: Each AC explicitly tested and confirmed
2. **Test Suite Passes**: All required testing levels complete
3. **Performance Benchmarks Met**: Browser test suite shows acceptable performance
4. **Documentation Updated**: Architecture and story docs reflect actual delivery
5. **Cross-browser Validation**: Functionality confirmed across target browsers

### ✅ **Before Epic Completion**
1. **Integration Testing**: All stories work together seamlessly
2. **End-to-End Validation**: Complete user workflows tested
3. **Performance Regression Testing**: No degradation from previous baselines
4. **Stakeholder Demo Ready**: Demonstrable value delivered

---

## Continuous Improvement

### ✅ **Retrospective Items**
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified and documented
- [ ] User feedback incorporated into future story planning
- [ ] Development workflow improvements identified
- [ ] Architecture patterns validated or refined

### ✅ **Technical Debt Management**
- [ ] Technical debt items documented for future sprints
- [ ] Performance optimization opportunities identified
- [ ] Code refactoring needs assessed

---

## Exceptions and Waivers

**Process for DoD Waivers:**
1. Product Owner approval required for any DoD exception
2. Technical debt item must be created for deferred work
3. Risk assessment must be documented
4. Timeline for completion must be established

**Common Acceptable Exceptions:**
- Performance optimization deferral (with technical debt item)
- Advanced browser compatibility (if usage data doesn't justify)
- Non-critical accessibility features (with future story planning)

---

## Notes

**Established**: Based on Story 1.1 enhanced delivery and architecture standards
**Review Cycle**: Updated after each epic completion or significant architectural change
**Compliance**: Monitored through browser test suite and manual validation

This Definition of Done reflects the professional standards established in Story 1.1 and ensures consistent quality across all future development.
