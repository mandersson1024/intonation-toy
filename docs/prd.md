## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a **fully immersive, GPU-rendered** real-time pitch detection interface that provides immediate visual feedback for audio input. **All end-user interactions must be rendered via GPU graphics using three-d** - HTML/CSS is strictly limited to development tools (console and debug overlay). The interface should prioritize performance and responsiveness while offering comprehensive development tools for debugging and configuration.

### Critical UI Architecture Constraint

**GPU-Only End-User Interface**: All user-facing controls, visualizations, and interactions must be rendered through the three-d graphics pipeline. HTML/CSS usage is restricted to:
- Development Console (Yew component for debugging)
- Debug Overlay (Yew component for performance metrics)
- Development-only tools and metering

**No HTML/CSS for Production UI**: Theme switching, pitch visualization, volume controls, and all user interactions must be implemented as GPU-rendered elements, not DOM elements.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Audio-Driven Interface**: Primary interaction through audio input with visual responses
- **Development-First Tooling**: Comprehensive debugging capabilities accessible through interactive console
- **Theme-Based Customization**: Visual theming system for different user preferences
- **Real-Time Responsiveness**: All visual elements respond to audio within specified latency targets

### Core Screens and Views

- **Main Pitch Visualization** (GPU-rendered): Immersive real-time pitch detection display with note identification and frequency information
- **Development Console** (HTML/Yew): Interactive command-line interface for debugging and configuration (development builds only)
- **Performance Metrics Display** (HTML/Yew): Real-time monitoring of frame rate, latency, and resource usage (development builds only)
- **Theme Selection Interface** (GPU-rendered): GPU-rendered controls for switching between available visual themes

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

- Browser compatibility across specified minimum versions
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive development console commands
- Clear visual indicators for audio processing states
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers

### Branding

- **Theme System**: Support for multiple visual themes as specified in technical architecture
- **Performance-First Design**: Visual design decisions guided by 60fps rendering requirements
- **Developer-Oriented Interface**: Clear, technical aesthetic appropriate for debugging and development

### Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive (Desktop and Mobile) - Modern browsers with WebAssembly and Web Audio API support including Chrome 66+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+, Edge 79+, iOS Safari 14.5+, and Chrome Android 66+

## Platform Requirements & Compatibility

### Critical Browser APIs (Application Cannot Start Without)

The application has **zero tolerance for missing critical APIs** and implements a **fail-fast policy** for platform validation:

- **WebAssembly Support**: Required for core application logic and audio processing
- **Web Audio API**: Required for microphone access and real-time audio processing  
- **getUserMedia API**: Required for microphone input capture
- **AudioWorklet**: Required for low-latency real-time audio processing
- **WebGL/Canvas Support**: Required for GPU-accelerated graphics rendering
- **MediaDevices API**: Required for device enumeration and permission management

### Application Startup Behavior

- **Fail Fast Policy**: If any critical browser API is missing, the application SHALL display a clear error message and prevent initialization
- **No Graceful Degradation**: The application SHALL NOT attempt to provide alternative implementations when critical APIs are unavailable
- **User Notification**: Missing feature errors SHALL include specific browser requirements and upgrade recommendations
- **Development Console Access**: Platform validation errors SHALL be accessible through development console commands for debugging

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Critical API Missing**: Application prevents startup with informative error screen
- **User Permission Denied**: Graceful handling with retry options and user guidance  
- **Device Unavailable**: Graceful handling with device reconnection logic
- **Runtime API Failures**: Error recovery where possible, graceful degradation for non-critical features only
