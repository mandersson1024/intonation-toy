# Modular Architecture Foundation - Epic Breakdown

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Author:** Winston (Architect)

## Overview

This document breaks down the foundational modular architecture implementation into **3 core epics** focusing on the essential infrastructure needed before other modules can be developed. These epics establish the communication backbone and core services that all other modules depend on.

**Implementation Priority:** These 3 epics must be completed **sequentially** as each depends on the previous one.

## Epic 1: Event Bus Infrastructure 🚌

**Epic ID:** `EPIC-001`  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks  
**Success Criteria:** Reliable inter-module communication with performance guarantees

### Epic Description

Create the central event bus system that enables **type-safe, performant communication** between all modules. This forms the backbone of the entire modular architecture, handling everything from critical real-time audio events to low-priority debug information.

### Key Features
- **Priority-based event routing** (Critical/High/Normal/Low)
- **Type-safe event publishing and subscription**
- **Zero-copy audio buffer sharing**
- **Performance monitoring and latency tracking**
- **Conditional debug event support**

### Technical Requirements
- Support **<1ms latency** for critical audio events
- Handle **1000+ events/second** without performance degradation
- Provide **compile-time type safety** for all event interactions
- Enable **zero-copy** audio data sharing between modules

### Stories in Epic 1
1. Core Event Bus Trait Definition (`STORY-001`)
2. Event Priority Queue Implementation (`STORY-002`)
3. Type-Safe Event Registration System (`STORY-003`)
4. Zero-Copy Buffer Reference Manager (`STORY-004`)
5. Performance Monitoring Integration (`STORY-005`)
6. Event Bus Testing Infrastructure (`STORY-006`)

## Epic 2: Application Core Module 🏗️

**Epic ID:** `EPIC-002`  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Dependencies:** Event Bus Infrastructure (EPIC-001)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Success Criteria:** Complete module lifecycle management and dependency injection

### Epic Description

Implement the **Application Core module** that orchestrates all other modules, manages their lifecycle, and provides dependency injection. This module serves as the foundation that all other modules register with and depend on for coordination.

### Key Features
- **Module registry and discovery**
- **Application lifecycle management** (startup, shutdown, configuration)
- **Dependency injection** for inter-module services
- **Configuration management** coordination
- **Error handling** escalation and recovery

### Technical Requirements
- Support **hot module registration** during development
- Provide **graceful shutdown** with proper cleanup
- Handle **module initialization failures** with recovery
- Enable **module isolation** for testing

### Stories in Epic 2
1. Module Registry Implementation (`STORY-007`)
2. Application Lifecycle Management (`STORY-008`)
3. Dependency Injection Container (`STORY-009`)
4. Module Configuration Coordination (`STORY-010`)
5. Error Recovery and Module Isolation (`STORY-011`)
6. Application Core Testing Suite (`STORY-012`)

## Epic 3: Audio Foundations Module 🎵

**Epic ID:** `EPIC-003`  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Dependencies:** Application Core Module (EPIC-002), Event Bus Infrastructure (EPIC-001)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 weeks  
**Success Criteria:** Real-time audio processing with existing performance maintained

### Epic Description

Migrate existing audio functionality into the **Audio Foundations module** while maintaining all current performance characteristics. This module handles microphone access, real-time pitch detection, signal generation, and performance monitoring within the new modular architecture.

### Key Features
- **Real-time audio processing** with <10ms latency
- **Multi-algorithm pitch detection** (YIN, McLeod)
- **Web Audio API device management**
- **Signal generation** for testing and calibration
- **Performance monitoring** and error reporting

### Technical Requirements
- **Zero performance regression** from current implementation
- Support **multiple pitch detection algorithms** with runtime switching
- Provide **comprehensive error handling** for audio failures
- Enable **hot configuration updates** without audio interruption

### Stories in Epic 3
1. Audio Engine Service Migration (`STORY-013`)
2. Device Manager Implementation (`STORY-014`)
3. Multi-Algorithm Pitch Detection (`STORY-015`)
4. Signal Generator Integration (`STORY-016`)
5. Performance Monitoring System (`STORY-017`)
6. Audio Event Publishing Integration (`STORY-018`)
7. Audio Foundations Testing Suite (`STORY-019`)

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** this epic breakdown
2. **Begin Epic 1** with Story 001 - Core Event Bus Trait Definition
3. **Set up project tracking** for epic and story progress
4. **Establish testing baseline** for performance regression detection

This foundation will enable rapid development of the remaining 5 modules (Graphics, Data Management, Platform Abstraction, Presentation Layer, Development Tools, Performance & Observability) in subsequent phases.
