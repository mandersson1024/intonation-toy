# Microphone Disconnect Detection Test

## Test Objective
Verify that the application correctly detects and reports when a microphone is unplugged after permission has been granted.

## Prerequisites
- USB microphone or external audio device that can be physically disconnected
- Browser with Web Audio API support
- Application running at http://localhost:8080

## Test Steps

### Setup
1. Launch the application in browser: http://localhost:8080
2. Open browser dev console to view debug messages
3. Ensure external microphone is connected and working

### Test Execution
1. **Grant Permission**
   - Click "üé§ Request Microphone Access" button
   - Grant permission when browser prompts
   - Verify status shows "‚úÖ Microphone access granted"
   - Check that no errors appear in the error panel

2. **Verify Normal Operation**
   - Confirm audio processing is working (if any visual indicators)
   - Check console for "Microphone permission granted" message

3. **Disconnect Microphone**
   - Physically unplug the USB microphone or disconnect external device
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for the browser to detect the disconnection

### Expected Results
After disconnecting the microphone:

1. **Console Messages**
   - Should see: "üé§ Microphone device disconnected - track ended"

2. **UI Changes**
   - Permission status icon changes to ‚ö†Ô∏è with "Microphone device disconnected"
   - NO button appears (automatic reconnection, no user action needed)
   - Error panel displays device disconnection error (not permission denied)

3. **Error Content**
   - Error message: "Microphone device disconnected"
   - Error category: Device Access (not Permission)
   - Note: "Reconnect your device - no additional permission needed"

### Recovery Test
1. **Reconnect Device**
   - Plug microphone back in
   - **No user action required** - automatic reconnection
   - Should see: "üé§ Device change detected, attempting reconnection..."
   - Should see: "üé§ Microphone automatically reconnected"
   - Error should clear and status should return to granted
   - Audio processing should resume automatically

## Implementation Details

The fix separates permission state from device connection state:

**Key Improvements:**
- **Proper State Separation**: Permission stays `Granted` when device disconnects
- **Device Monitoring**: Monitors `track.onended` events for disconnection detection  
- **Appropriate Error Type**: Uses `DeviceAccess` error category instead of `Permission`
- **No Manual Reconnection**: Follows browser behavior - no button required for reconnection
- **Clear User Messaging**: Error explains that no additional permission is needed

**Technical Details:**
- Monitors `track.onended` events for each audio track to detect disconnection
- Creates `microphone_device_disconnected` error with clear messaging
- Listens for `navigator.mediaDevices.ondevicechange` events
- Automatically attempts to get new MediaStream when device reconnects
- Sets up track monitoring on the new stream for future disconnections
- Maintains permission state throughout the disconnect/reconnect cycle

## Browser Compatibility

This feature relies on:
- MediaStreamTrack.onended event support
- Available in all modern browsers (Chrome 26+, Firefox 22+, Safari 11+)

## Known Limitations

- Detection timing depends on browser implementation
- Some browsers may take 1-3 seconds to fire the ended event
- Bluetooth device disconnection may behave differently than USB devices
