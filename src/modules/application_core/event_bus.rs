//! # Event Bus Infrastructure
//!
//! This module provides the core event bus infrastructure for type-safe inter-module communication.
//! The event system enables modules to publish and subscribe to events without tight coupling,
//! with compile-time type safety and performance optimizations for real-time audio processing.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - [`Event`]: Base trait for all events with metadata
//! - [`EventBus`]: Core event publishing and subscription interface
//! - [`EventHandler`]: Type-safe event processing handlers
//! - [`EventPriority`]: Priority levels for event processing order
//!
//! ## Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crate::modules::application_core::event_bus::*;
//! use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};
//!
//! // Define a custom event
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
//! struct AudioProcessingEvent {
//!     frequency: f32,
//!     confidence: f32,
//!     timestamp: u64,
//! }
//!
//! impl Event for AudioProcessingEvent {
//!     fn event_type(&self) -> &'static str {
//!         "AudioProcessingEvent"
//!     }
//!
//!     fn timestamp(&self) -> u64 {
//!         self.timestamp
//!     }
//!
//!     fn priority(&self) -> EventPriority {
//!         EventPriority::High
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Implement event handler
//! struct AudioEventHandler;
//!
//! impl EventHandler<AudioProcessingEvent> for AudioEventHandler {
//!     fn handle_event(&mut self, event: &AudioProcessingEvent) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!         println!("Processed audio event: frequency={}, confidence={}", 
//!                  event.frequency, event.confidence);
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Base trait for all events in the system.
///
/// Events must be Send + Sync + Clone to support multi-threaded event processing
/// and efficient event distribution. All events include metadata for debugging,
/// monitoring, and processing optimization.
///
/// ## Implementation Requirements
///
/// - `event_type()`: Must return a unique string identifier for the event type
/// - `timestamp()`: Should use high-precision timestamp for latency analysis
/// - `priority()`: Should match the urgency and timing requirements of the event
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// - Clone should be efficient (consider Arc for large data)
/// - Avoid large data payloads in events - use buffer references instead
/// - timestamp() should use monotonic time for accurate latency measurement

///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// Handlers should return errors for processing failures. The event bus
/// will handle error reporting and potential retry logic based on the
/// error type and event priority.
///
/// ## Performance Requirements
///
/// - Critical event handlers must complete in <1ms
/// - High priority handlers should complete in <10ms
/// - Avoid blocking operations in event handlers
/// - Use async handlers for I/O operations (future enhancement)

///
/// - Type-safe event routing with compile-time verification

///

///
/// ```rust
/// // Publishing events
/// let event = MyEvent::new();
/// event_bus.publish(event)?;
///
/// // Subscribing to events  
/// let handler = MyEventHandler::new();
/// event_bus.subscribe::<MyEvent>(Box::new(handler))?;
