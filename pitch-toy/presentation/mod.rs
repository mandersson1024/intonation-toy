//! Presentation Layer - Visualization and user interface
//! 
//! This layer is responsible for:
//! - Visual rendering and graphics display
//! - User interface elements and interactions
//! - Screen management and layout
//! - Event handling and user input
//! - Visual feedback and animations
//! - Debug visualization and overlays
//! 
//! ## Current Status
//! 
//! This is a placeholder implementation. The Presenter struct accepts all required
//! interfaces but does not yet implement any functionality. All methods are stubs
//! that compile and run without errors.
//! 
//! ## Future Implementation
//! 
//! When fully implemented, this layer will:
//! - Receive processed data from the model layer
//! - Render visual representations of pitch and volume
//! - Handle user interactions and input
//! - Send user actions to the model layer
//! - Manage screen layout and visual elements
//! - Provide visual feedback for audio processing

/// Presenter - The presentation layer of the three-layer architecture
/// 
/// This struct represents the visual rendering and user interface layer
/// of the application. It receives processed data from the model layer
/// and renders visual representations while handling user interactions.
/// 
/// # Placeholder Implementation
/// 
/// This is currently a placeholder that:
/// - Accepts all required interfaces in the constructor
/// - Stores interfaces with underscore prefixes (unused)
/// - Provides stub methods that do nothing
/// - Always returns success (Ok) from fallible operations
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// ```no_run
/// use pitch_toy::module_interfaces::*;
/// use pitch_toy::presentation::Presenter;
/// use three_d::RenderTarget;
/// 
/// let model_to_presentation = model_to_presentation::ModelToPresentationInterface::new();
/// let presentation_to_model = presentation_to_model::PresentationToModelInterface::new();
/// 
/// let presenter = Presenter::create(
///     model_to_presentation,
///     presentation_to_model,
/// ).expect("Presenter creation should always succeed");
/// 
/// // Later in render loop:
/// // let mut screen = frame_input.screen();
/// // presenter.render(&mut screen);
