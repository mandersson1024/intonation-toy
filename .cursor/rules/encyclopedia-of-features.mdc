## Introduction

**What this document is**  
A feature-focused manual that explains what the software can do — both visible tools and invisible mechanisms — for users, contributors, and AI agents.

## Active Features

#### **Microphone Permission Request**
Before the app can listen to your voice, it needs your permission to access the microphone.

How it appears to users:
The first time you open the app (or use the input feature), your operating system will show a popup asking if you want to allow microphone access.

Behind the scenes:
The app uses the system audio API to capture live audio input. When this request is made, the OS handles permission dialogs. If denied, audio input won't work — but the app will display a helpful warning.
