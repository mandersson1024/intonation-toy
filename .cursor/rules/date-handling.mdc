When creating documents that need dates:

1. **Always use the actual current date** - never guess or use placeholder dates
2. **To get today's date**: Use the terminal command `date` or ask the user for the current date
3. **Format**: Use format "Month YYYY" (e.g., "January 2024") for document headers
4. **Don't assume**: Never assume what month or year it is
